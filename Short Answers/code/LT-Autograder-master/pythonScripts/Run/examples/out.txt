Text:	The procedure needs to state the four types of samples it is using, (marbles, limestone, wood, plastic). You need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup. You need a set amount. You could also do the time at different times. So you could do it at is at 30 and at 45 minutes to see if there is a change at all in the mass over time.

Text:	The procedure should include what the four different samples are. At this point it is to vague and needs to be specified. The procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers. The procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. Finally, the procedure does not include a control. This doesn't give the readers anything to compare the results.

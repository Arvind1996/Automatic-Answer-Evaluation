2230	1	a procedure is exposed to be showing you how to do this experiment . the experiment is missing a lot of things . for example the first thing saved in this procedure is determine the mass of four different samples . that should not be the first step in the procedure . it should be to gather the materials tell you how to set up the materials . it should tell you what different liquid that should be placed into each container and what to rabble on the container . it should tell you the size of the container to . it should tell you what temperature the room should be and how much of the solution should be placed into the container .
2231	1	after reading the groups procedure these pieces of information they would need to include in order for me to replicate the experiment are p . in this procedure they need to be specific with which samples their talking about . one needs to see that to the procedure the samples are marble limestone wood and plastic . p . the students need to include how many grams of each sample of each substance are needed . p . the students need to include what type or kind of vinegar they are using . different types could lead to sources of error which could effect the final outcome of the experiment .
2232	1	the information you would need to know to replicate the experiment are how much vinegar to put into the cups with the samples . also what size cup to put the vinegar and sample in . lastly you would need to have a constant place for them to sit for hours so you would need to know the temperatures of the room as well as vinegar . all of these things could potentially affect the experiment .
2233	1	there are at least three things missing from the instructing . first how much vinegar do you pour into the container what is the size of the container . and what do we use to measure the mass of the samples these are three of many problems need corrected .
2234	1	i would need to know were they left the samples for hours . depending on the climate there it can affect how it behaves . i would also need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container depending on how much can affect the mass of each sample . one more thing that i would need to know to replicate this experiment would be if any of the samples were lashed out or removed from the containers when washing each sample with distilled water that would affect the end mass a lot .
2235	1	in order for me to replicate these experiment they would need to include the names of the samples in their procedure . they would need to include that need to find the mass of the samples before i begin the process and very need to include that i would need to find the difference of the beginning and end masses in grams .
2236	1	to do this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each of the containers . where would the containers be housed our exposure to such can cause a validity error . also missing off the samples create a validity issue . the samples should be massed again when they come out of the containers . what kind of containers
2237	1	to replicate the experiment we would have to know how much vinegar in each container . they would need to name each of the material . explain to put each material into a different continue that was filled with vinegar .
2238	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . also i would need to know what temperature to keep the containers in and how big each container needed to be that i was putting the samples and vinegar in to .
2239	1	i will need the information about how they determined the mass of the four different samples and how much vinegar they poured in each container . also what type of vinegar .
2240	1	first i would need to know how to get the initial weight of each substance . next i would need to know how to find the missing mass i would need to know maybe what kind of containers they were or what size they had to be . i would finally need to know where the samples should sit .
2241	1	to replicate the experiment they should list what samples you have to use that you have to find its ending mass and the difference between both masses . this should come after step in .
2242	1	the additional information i would need is starting mass counting mass and difference in mass .
2243	1	to complete this procedure they should have given the amount of vinegar and the size of the container . they should have also said what samples to use and what to label them . they could have even added in how to determine the mass .
2244	1	in order to replicate the experiment the procedure must include what four samples we would be testing . another key part is identifying how much vinegar is in needed to put in the container which decides the variable . other mistakes include the variables need to be identified so that we know what has to affect the other in order for it to be a productive experiment .
2245	1	there are few additional pieces of information needed in the procedure . first of all the procedure should include what kind of
2246	1	to replicate this experiment you would need larger amounts of the sample .
2247	1	if you wanted to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of vinegar was used how much vinegar was used and what materials of container was used . you would need to know this in order to keep the experiment constant .
2248	1	the additional information i would need is how big each sample is like in width and height so they are all equal . also i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container without these facts the experiment could turn out wrong because every sample has to be controlled in in order to receive the correct information .
2249	1	after reading the group procedure the following things would still need to be added the first would be the type of container they say it should be separate but identical but they should list how large it should be also they should add how much vinegar is needed in each container to keep the experiment constant to the experiment to make sure that they are accurate results .
2250	1	to conduct this experiment properly they would need to include the types of containers how much one sample of the substance is and what the substance that is being tested is . without this important information the experiment could not be properly redone with accurate results .
2251	1	after reading the group s procedure i determined that the additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is the exact measurement of vinegar to put in each of the four single containers determining the difference in mass between before and after and labeling the containers . the additional information explained above will all help to replicate the experiment .
2252	1	one piece of information is how large are the containers second what is this for and three why does it need to be separate but identical containers . that doesn t mack much science .
2253	1	wood is the answer because wood take vapor
2254	1	the additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is the amount of the for sample you are using that takes testing on the amount of vinegar used and how much is put into each container . also you would need to know the specifics of how much is used either grams military etc . you would also need to know how much water you used to rise off samples and how large the containers were to what their mass was .
2255	1	to replicate the experiment precisely i would need additional information on how much vinegar they used which type of vinegar and what the temperature of the vinegar was .
2256	1	the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment would be p . how much vinegar is poured in each of the four containers . p . which sample had the highest mass difference after the procedure and which had the lowest change . p . all the samples would have equal the same mass at the beginning of this procedure .
2257	1	according to the group s procedure there is additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment . first the would need to say the four different samples marble limestone wood and plastic . secondly they did not tell us how much vinegar we need to use . lastly how much of each sample are we supposed to use
2258	1	after reading this group procedure they could have added the type of invited to place in which sample .
2259	1	first of all i would need the problem of the experiment stated so i can state . i would also need the amount of vinegar stated so all cups can be even . i would also need what type of vinegar was used .
2260	1	in order to replicate the group experiment the additional information you need to saw is what the samples were how much vinegar is used and how to measure the four different samples you need to know what the samples were in the experiment because you need to know what to use when your repeating it so you cant just use anything . you need to know how much vinegar is used for a repeated experiment . finally you need to know how to measure the four different samples to get the right and accurate data .
2261	1	additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is what the samples are how to find the mass of a sample and how long to rinse each sample for .
2262	1	you need to put an equal amount of vinegar in each sample . you also should test would a little longer to see if it really doesn t loose any mass if an acid sounds it .
2263	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would have to know how much vinegar i need to pour into each of the containers . in order for this to be reliable i would have to use the same amount of vinegar . the amount of vinegar could effect the difference in mass of each sample . i would also need to know what i am labeling on each container . i would also need to know how long to rinse each sample .
2264	1	based on the students procedure i would need to know what the four samples are how much mass per sample and the amount of vinegar poured onto the samples . other useful information would include temperature and size of rocks for the sample .
2265	1	for this procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar . i would also need to know more information of the materials . in the procedure they also should of been specific in how many times you had to repeat it .
2266	1	record the starting mass and ending mass then solo tract the two masses . to find the difference in mass . the four different samples are marble limestone wood and plastic . create a data table with samples starting mass g ending mass g and difference in mass g and record the data in the table .
2267	1	in order to replicate this experiment one would need to know how much vinegar they need to pour into each of the containers . one would also need to know the method by which they should calculate the mass of the samples before and after the experimental pressure . thirdly one would need to know what the different samples to detested were . these very important items were not included in the procedure .
2268	1	where did the rain come from in the first place how much water is each container
2269	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need what four things are being sampled how much vinegar to put in each sample so i don t put too little or too much . also i d need to know how much of each material i will need to put in the four identical containers .
2270	1	in order to replicate the procedure we could need to know how much amount of rain have failed onto the samples and how strong was the acid rain because it seems that the limestone was mostly affected when the other samples was least affected .
2271	1	the procedure that the students come up with can not be easily replicated . there is no list of materials that need to be gathered for this experiment . there are also construction al errors . it would be helpful to have constants in the experiment or things that are kept the same through all samples such as how much vinegar to put in the cups . there is also constant or sample that the others can be compared to such as a sample placed in water versus vinegar .
2272	1	some additional information that you would need is how much vinegar would you need to put in each container . another piece of information that you would need is where would you put the samples for the hours . would if a in a refrigerator of on a counter . the last piece of information that you would need is what would be in of the water that you are washing the samples in would the water be hot warm or cold .
2273	1	the additional information needed is a control variable . they need to state what material was put in first how they determined the mass what kind of a container their talking about and was there any thing in those containers .
2274	1	other additional information that you would need to know to replicate this experiment is what samples to use how much of each sample and how much vinegar to poor in each cup .
2275	1	the addition information that i would need in the procedure would be what materials i would need to do the experiment . then i would need to know how much vinegar to put in the four contains . finally i would need to know . i would need to know the starting mass of each sample .
2276	1	five pieces of additional information would be to what you would measure the samples with whether it be a scale or something else . p . how much vinegar to put in each of the container . p . whether or not the amount of vinegar is constant in each of the four containers and is where to put the samples the hours it is left experimenting and suitor it be in a fridge somewhere cold the sun somewhere hot or room temperature .
2277	1	one thing i would need to know is how much vinegar goes into the containers . another thing is how much of each substance would go in the containers what temperature should the liquid vinegar be to what temperature do we let the samples dry
2278	1	in the procedure the students should have started by adding which ho trials they were using so that somebody else could actually replicate the experiment when passing the vinegar no specific change were written which could change the end results . it would have also been helpful if the students explained what the starting mass of each material was .
2279	1	in order to repeat this experiment one would need additional information . one thing would be to know how much vinegar to measure out . another would be to know the size of the additional containers . lastly one would need to know how much distilled water to rinse with .
2280	1	the students should have put how they dried the samples and if they put it on something put what it was . also should have had the amount of vinegar they used .
2281	1	some additional information that is needed is how much vinegar was added to the container . another piece of information needed is are the sample materials all the same size you would also need to know what temperature the materials were held at for the hour time period .
2282	1	one thing the group could have done was concentrated on a specific sample such as marble then stated the others as samples . meaning they could have said for step . put a marble sample into a container with vinegar and label . repeat . . . they also did not specify neither how big the containers were nor how much vinegar to pour in .
2283	1	after reading the groups procedure in order to replicate the experiment you would have to find out which sample goes with which mixture to make the samples replicate with another .
2284	1	the students would need a clear statement of the problem . they would need to explain why they were determining the mass of four samples they also would need a hypothesis they should explain what they think their experiment will turnout . finally they need a conclusion telling what happened at the end of the experiment .
2285	1	in the information you would . the mass g starting with the wood stranger then the plastic that have more . then difference in mass o . i .
2286	1	in the procedure we would have to know what samples we are testing . also if each example was p starting at the same mass . in the step it just says pour vinegar . we need to know in exact amount to have each container the same that could be a factor that would set off the experiment .
2287	1	something else you would need to add to this procedure is how much liquid was put into the containers . also the things that you need in order to do this procedure .
2288	1	some extra information that you would need wait be what are the four different samples how much vinegar do i pour into each containers how big are the containers and how much distilled water do i use to rinse with .
2289	1	in order to replicate this experiment the group would have to put what kind sample i would be putting in each container because i could put any kind of material in the containers instead of what the group put which would make our data completely different . the group should indicate how to determine the mass of each sample after it sat in the vinegar . most importantly this group needs to indicate what they used as a control in their experiment because they need to compare acid rain or vinegar to normal the normal erosion of the samples when it is rained on with common everyday water .
2290	1	to replicate this experiment we would need to know what each samples are and how much of each sample goes into the containers . the procedure also must state that we record our data after each measurement and the procedure should specify how much vinegar goes into each container . the last step of the procedure should tell us to subtract the starting and ending mass to determine the difference in mass .
2291	1	the additional information that i would need is the type of mass i would also need to know on what are factor i needed to put the mass i would also need to know what subject i am going be using . i would need to know how much vinegar i would need to put in the container .
2292	1	additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be . a control sample should had ben part of the prosper . i detest the experiment take be for results . would also need to test the ph of the vinegar .
2293	1	we need to know what are the four samples . how much of each sample we need what unit to measure how much vinegar to pour in each cup and what word you label the cups .
2294	1	some additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar used . another thing that would be needed is a set set starting mass for each sample b c then every time you replicate the experiment the same mass of the samples is used the result can be compared . the group should also clearly state the samples used in the procedure that way the experiment can be replicated .
2295	1	well i think that when they move the mass from one containers to another container there is when everything start changing with the temperature when we remove it it gets an a different size .
2296	1	the groups procedure runs act . wages and final rest
2297	1	to replicate this experiment i would need to know exactly how much vinegar should be turned into the container so that each container can have the same amount of vinegar . i would also need to know what type of instrument was used to measure the mass of each rock so i would be able to use it to measure the starting weight and then add the same and when measuring the ending weight .
2298	1	in addition to the procedure there are many more specific steps . this group of students would have to include . step number talks about pouring vinegar into containers but they did not include how much vinegar to put in each container . so being more specific would make the experiment more valid . in step it says to rinse with distilled stating how much water would be a better choice having a content would help the students improve the mass of the other samples .
2299	1	in the procedure they didnt explain it right because they left out marking the four samples the didnt label the containers to let us know pacific ally .
2300	1	after reading the procedure i would add to an the procedure step more times so you know that the experiment is valid . also they can use different kinds of water to see if it does anything to the mass .
2301	1	additional information that you may need in order to replicate the experiment might be the amount of distilled water needed to add . if you are putting a different amount of distilled water in each container the results could not be accurate . the difference in masses very from . . . . this would be inaccurate without the proper measuring .
2302	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar that was supplied to each sample because that must stay constant . i would also need to know how to label each container and where to store the samples for hours .
2303	1	. check if the samples is difference . p . check if the sample after more day . p . then check all the sample one to one .
2304	1	after reviewing the procedure some additional information that i would include is what do you do after you not it it get for it mass . also what would you do before you determine the mass of four different samples . furthermore what mass they trying to test .
2305	1	the group needs to explain how determine the mass of the samples in the first step . then they need to put how much vinegar into the containers in step number two . finally they need to tell what the kind of containers are being used such as size shape and material .
2306	1	first and foremost i d need the materials if didn t know what it is that i m working with then how could i do it also the problem i need to know what i m trying to figure out . one more thing that d be pretty useful is the hypothesis . note to take their answer but compare it to mine and see where both our heads are at .
2307	1	you will need a control you could also figure out witch substance had the most least effect by using a ph meter .
2308	1	in this procedure you would need the names of each sample used identify the mass of containers and to record data on a table .
2309	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container . you would also need to know what kind of vinegar was used so you can use the same kind . lastly you would need to know what the students are investigating they didn t include a purpose . all of this would need to be known because with out specific details an experiment can change .
2310	1	to replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar they poured into each cup . also they could show up how long they rinsed the samples for . it could change the mass if they did one longer than the other . finally they could have done a second test to see if there test was correct .
2311	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar is being poured in each of the four containers step how much is a sample of the materials being tested how much of them should be put in each container step and how you are going to determine the mass of these dependable variables steps and .
2312	1	i think that wood wouldn t be the best source for acid rain or plastic .
2313	1	they should of included what kind of containers the samples should go in they should of told you in the directions how they wanted it measured the making of the table should have also been included . also should of included measurements of the samples .
2314	1	you need to add the average weight of the mass before starting the experiment . at first before starting . write your predict .
2315	1	you would need to know how much vinegar you need to use and also the concentration of vinegar . finally you would need to know the temperature at which the experiment should be performed .
2316	1	you would need vinegar you would need tables to label the containers . and you would also need identical containers .
2317	1	in order to replicate this experiment the procedure must be clarified or should say how to determine the mass and it should say what the four samples are also in step it should say how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container . in step it should be stated what material should be placed into what container also how it should be labeled .
2318	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container . you would need to know which rock was in which containers and you would need to know which rock is which .
2319	1	students should add an explanation of why they are doing this experiment .
2320	1	additional information the person conducting the experiment would need to include and make sure each sample of marble limestone wood and piloted is the exact same weight refuse being put into the vinegar . by having each scrape weigh something different the acid another ve naive to the experiment making the delia not precise .
2321	1	need to know what are you using in order to get the mass . what you just counting with fingers . why do you need the sample to sit not for hours . finally what is all the materials that you ll need .
2322	1	how much vinegar do they have to pour where do they put the container how do they dry it do they air dry it or do they put it in a machine
2323	1	to replicate this procedure you would need the specific type of container . the amount of mass would change between container . you would also need to know the amount of water used to wash fully the vinegar . last you would need to know the amount of vinegar put in each cup for with more vinegar more rocks could be eroded .
2324	1	how much vinegar do we put in each sample and is there a control variable for this experiment . what kind of place do the samples sit to get the best result . how much distilled water do we rinse each sample with wouldn t that screw up the weight .
2325	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers . you would also need to know if you should let the samples dry inside the container in hot air cold air inside outside things like that you would need to know to replicate this experiment .

2327	1	in order to repeat this experiment i would require the control . nowhere in this experiment does it state me . aside from that i need to know how many ml of vinegar to add me in what size container . all these minor details must also remain constant throughout to maintain validity . these should also be more trials to increase the experiments accuracy and validity .
2328	1	in order to replicate the experiment you need to know what the sample of materials they are using . also you would need to weigh each sample at the start of the experiment to find its starting mass you would also need to tell us to find the difference in mass from the start to the end of each sample .
2329	1	in order to replicate the students experiment they would also have to describe the amount of vinegar they put in each cup and keep it constant . the students should also record the temp of the vinegar and do o they wash the rocks in . also the students should of had more than one trial to make their data more valid .
2330	1	the thing you need in order to replicate is to add more acid rain they allow the samples to sit and dry for minutes .
2331	1	you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each jar you will also need to know what problem you are trying to solve . with out knowing the problem you have no ideas what the data is for making it utterly useless .
2332	1	for this experiment the group could put averaging the difference of the mass in the procedure record the starting mass and write that they recorded the end mass . they left all these examples out .
2333	1	the first thing i would need in addition to doing the experiment is first how or with what scale do i measure the samples with . second what am i testing must need the names of the samples . third how much of the vinegar . do i put into the container . fourth how much of the sample do i put into the vinegar . all of those things are needed is additional for doing the experiment .
2334	1	i would put how much of the vinegar you put into the containers . also how much mass it has .
2335	1	in the procedure it doesn t specify how much vinegar to use it also didn t specify what type of samples to use . it also doesn t can how much of each sample to use .
2336	1	to replicate the experiment the additional information that you would need would be what you need to know how much vinegar that you have to put in each of the four identical containers . and what kind of samples and how much of each sample .
2337	1	i would need to know the indecent variable the dependent variable the controlled variable .
2338	1	after reading this group s procedure there is some additional information i would need in order to replicate their experiment . first of all i would need to know exactly how much vinegar was poured into each sample . also i would need to know what temperature or condition the samples were stored at while sitting in the vinegar . lastly knowing the type of materials would be important in replicating this group s experiment .
2339	1	for completing this experiment you might need to know exactly how vinegar is in the containers . you would also need to know the size of the container and ie the vinegar is to completely be emerging the samples . the area in the room would also be a soothing to know about
2340	1	information that you would need to replicate this experiment is a problem what the samples are and labels for each container .
2341	1	before being able to replicate this experiment there is additional information you would need to know . one major piece of information that is not included in the procedure is what the four different samples are . they would need to specify marble limestone wood and plastic . other information they would need add to the procedure what to put the substances in because a container isn t specific enough and how to measure the mass .
2342	1	in order to replicate this experiment a few things must be added to this procedure . for example the procedure should mention the four samples they are using . also the procedure should be more specific in telling what kind of container to use . lastly the procedure asks to measure the mass of the samples but it should be specific in what units of measurement to use .
2343	1	first you would need to know what the materials were that you were soaking in the vinegar . they are a marble limestone wood and plastic . also you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container . finally you would need to know what you were measuring the mass of the objects with .
2344	1	i would need additional information to replicate this experiment by knowing what texture to leave the containers in for hours . i would also need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers to start and how big the sample items are .
2345	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what materials you would have no clue what materials you were using . you would also need to know the preparations to the experiment just in case there were using dangerous objects or substances being used . lastly to be able to replicate the procedure you would need to how they came up with the mass and difference in mass because there are many ways to get mass .
2346	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know where the containers of substances were kept and if they were exposed to other elements . also you would need to know where they were left to dry after being removed from the containers . you need to know specifies such as if the containers . do you know which substance you are measuring .
2347	1	i think its batter of with limestone because it will cell it saver than the oder staff .
2348	1	the group could have add the name of the sample used in the experiment to make the first procedure more dear they also could have added a characteristic change to look for in procedure . p the first list procedure could have been collect all materials the procedure could have also included measurements .
2349	1	in order to replicate this experiment you first need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . you would also need to know what was the samples on what kind of scale lastly it is necessary to know the light and temperature conditions you are letting the samples skin .
2350	1	one additional piece of information necessary to duplicate this experiment is the volume amount of vinegar put into each container . another piece of information is the size of the container to be sure to cover the whole material with vinegar . also the type of sample would need to be provided to duplicate this experiment for example what type of wood maple oak
2351	1	the groups procedure could be improved by specifying what the samples are . until i read the results i did not know that the samples are different types of rocks . p the procedure could also be improved by adding the a control which could be doing the same procedure but replacing the vinegar with water . the procedure should also include the amount of vinegar added to the samples .
2352	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use how big the sample sizes were and if you can use any material not the ones given . the size factors are the most important because too much or too little can cause the results to be incorrect .
2353	1	they would have to include the size of the container size of the samples how much vinegar how much distilled water to rinse them off with .
2354	1	i don t know how much vinegar to use p starting mass has no control p at what temperature do you store the samples
2355	1	an additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is .
2356	1	one thing that you would need to do is state how much vinegar to pour into each sample then they could do the experiment more than once because sometimes just one experiment doesn t get it done . you want more so if it was invalid once you will have some valid numbers . also make sure the samples are kept at the same temperatures in the same environment so that does not turn into another variable .
2357	1	in order to replicate the experiment more steps needs to be added to the experiment . you would to clean your supplies gather brand new samples and repeat the steps .
2358	1	after reading the group s procedure you would need to know what type of samples are needed to replicate the experiment . also you must know how much vinegar must be added into each cup since it would be a constant measure . also it would be helpful to know the temperature needed because temperature can change the outcome of the experiment .
2359	1	additional information that you would need to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured in the containers the names of the four samples used and where we should let the samples dry .
2360	1	additional information that you would need is how much vinegar you need . what size containers are you going to use .
2361	1	one thing that would be necessary to know from the procedure is what we are collecting . it tells us to collect four different samples . i don t know what that means . a sample could be of anything . next there should be a direction for collecting a certain amount of the samples because if the amounts were different then there would be two independent variables . lastly
2362	1	if i were to recreate this experiment i would not the different types of samples that were going to be tested secondly i would specify the amount of vinegar that should be added to the sample s containers . lastly i would specify what to use for the drying process such as a watch glass and also what apparatus i would be using to weigh the mass of the samples .
2363	1	the additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be what materials are to be used . the procedure
2364	1	in this groups procedure one thing they do not specify is what four different samples and of what you are measuring . also they say report but identical containers . the group should tell us what size and kind of container to use . another measurement that is going to play a huge role is how much vinegar and how much of each sample are put in the containers . those are couple attics they should add to their procedure .
2365	1	in the procedure of acid rain the procedure doesn t name the samples they are using . it also doesn t say how much the mass is for example in this case it s g . it also doesn t show the materials .
2366	1	additional information that would be necessary to replicate the experiment would be what the problem is that we re trying to solve . another important piece of information would be specifically what kinds of samples should be used and the last good and necessary information would be what the control group would be a control group is always good for comparing data and results .
2367	1	one piece of information would be to repeat the steps . another important information you would use in order to replicate the experiment is to add more data tables . lastly you would need to add another different mass to the table .
2368	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know the types of samples are being used because in the procedure there is nothing that tells me . also they don t give details such as how to weigh the samples before and after the experiment . one more important thing is that i would need to know how much vinegar to place in each cup or the validity could be affected .
2369	1	you will need to know how much vinegar you put in each container . you will also need to know what materials you will need to complete this experiment finally you need to know what to do with your data after . for example analyze your graph .
2370	1	to prepare the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cue i wall need to know how the measuring the and mass into vinegar substance . i would need to know how many of each same they uses they concludes the experiment .
2371	1	the additional information that is needed to improve this experiment is you need the heat the vinegar so it is easy to compare to other experiments you also need to know the hypothesis and independent variable they do not tell you the state forward . you need to tell the person that s going to replicate this what you are true he to do .
2372	1	in this groups procedure they should have included a control . also they do not state the amount of vinegar that should be added to each of the containers . lastly they should set at what mass each sample was at that produced these specific results .
2373	1	in order to replicate the experiment i need determine the mass of the sample . i have to check the time and remove the samples i . e from the containers . i have to wait for the sample to dry for minutes . i have to college the differences in mass .
2374	1	the additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is what samples i should use . another would be how much vinegar i should pour into each sample container and what materials i would need such as to determine mass .
2375	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass they would need the time that was for the samples it can be by hour or minutes .
2376	1	the three pieces of additional information i would need to replicate the experiment would be the starting mass ending mass and its difference in mass .
2377	1	in order for me to be able to repeat this experiment they would have to include how much vinegar to put into each cup . what kind of containers and what weather conditions to keep the containers in .
2378	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the four different samples are what to label the containers and after the hours were to you remove the samples from the containers .
2379	1	in the procedure the group needs to add what kind of material samples they are using . they also need to identify how much vinegar they are adding to the containers . also what will you label the containers once you have the vinegar materials in it all that needs to be put in the procedure in order to replicate the experiment .
2380	1	in order to replicate the experiment this procedure would need some additional information . one piece of information needed is the amount of vinegar that the students poured into the containers . also the students should have added what the four different samples were in the procedure . another piece of information the procedure is missing is to record the masses . with these three additional pieces of information someone could replicate the experiment .
2381	1	there is not enough information to replicate the experiment . one bit of information i would need is the amount of each sample in grams that is required . i would also need the amount of vinegar to add to each sample . ml . the samples used are also not expressed in the procedure but they are in the table . the size of the container also matters because that would decide the area affected by vinegar . the type of vinegar what percentage is also needed . also temperature could have in affect and that is not expressed through the procedure .
2382	1	we would need the repeat information to determine the mass right . we need the marble plastic and wood .
2383	1	addition information i would add is the environment its in .
2384	1	in this experiment they could improve a few of the things they didn t include . first of all they didn t state how much vinegar they added to each of the humerus . they also don t have a control in other experiment so it would be better if they had a control so that the could compare the results of the different samples to the control they also could use use more trials and one if the results are different or the same as before .
2385	1	you will need the mass of four different samples . you need to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers . place a sample of one material into one container and label . repeat with the other samples .
2386	1	in step three the instructions need to be clearer they should tell me to put each sample into its own container . also there were no measurements given in order to replicate the experiment i would need exact measurements of how much of each sample i need to use . step four should also be split up to make the instructions clear such as y let the samples sit for hours p . remove samples from the containers p . rinse samples with distilled water .
2387	1	well reading the groups procedure i found that they missed some information the information i would include are the amount of verge poured into the identical containers next is the temperature that the containers are in . i would make sure that the temperature is a steady temperature and i would also say to include the type of vinegar because their are many different kinds of vinegar so you would have to make sure its the same type .
2388	1	to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the four samples were and you would also need to know how big the samples were when you put them in also you would need to know how much vinegar to put in to each cup .
2389	1	you would need the amount of vinegar in each container . the amount of how much the containers weigh . also how much water you use to clean the marbles . when you started and when you finished the procedure .
2390	1	you would need to weigh the containers before and after you would possibly need a calculator for finding the difference in mass . you would also need to know how much vinegar to pot in each container .
2391	1	they needed to be more specific on what to use for samples . it doesn t specify how much vinegar to use and it doesn t say label all four samples containers .
2392	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to our in the separate but identical containers . i would also need to know what type of containers to use whether beakers or something rinse . lastly i would need to know how much distilled water i would need to use as well as what instrument to use for measuring masses .
2393	1	additional information you would need would be how much vinegar you put in each container . you would also need to know what samples you would use because it does not say in the procedure . finally you would need to say for how long you would rinse the samples because each one has to be identically done .
2394	1	the additional information that the group should have added is the amount of vinegar being poured into each tube . also they should indicate the amount of material they placed in each container . also the should have made the labeling more specific .
2395	1	you would need the same amount of each material because in order to get the same data you need the same amount of everything . p you need to figure out the mass of the object when you start and the mass of the object when it ends . p the last thing you need to have is to make sure that each sample is done at the same time otherwise it will be inaccurate .
2396	1	in order to replicate the group s experiment you would need to determine how much vinegar that needs to be put into the containers with measurements so that nothing gets changed . also the samples that the kids used all have to have the same starting masses which would lead to the same ending masses . and the children should all use the same type of vinegar and cups so that nothing would change because of how they are in the same testing tools .
2397	1	thing that needs to be added is how much vinegar is poured . without this everyone would get different results . another thing is there a top to put on the container it doesn t say . also the last thing that they forget to put is if the container was in room temperature or hot . without knowing this it could ruin the whole experiment .
2398	1	some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment would be what did they use to measure the weight of the samples and what units was it in what are the materials that you are supposed to pour in with the vinegar . and how much vinegar sample you are supposed to put into each container .
2399	1	in order to replicate this experiment additional information is required . one would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container . also it would be necessary to know what type of containers were used . a list of materials would ensure accurate replication of the s experiment as well as description about how to measure the mass of the materials .
2400	1	additional information you would need to repeat the experiment would be to identify the amount of vinegar being poured into each cup and have the samples weigh the same amount in the beginning of the experiment . the amount of vinegar is needed so that is eliminated as a variable . the starting mass should be the same so it is easier to compare and contrast one sample to another recording the temperature of the samples or even where they are placed in the room would be helpful so you can determine if the temperature in variable and then you have the clothing to continue .
2401	1	to be able to replicate this experiment they must include how much vinegar to add . also at what temperature the samples should sit and dry and how to find the mass of each sample .
2402	1	to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the four samples are and how much of the four samples . you would also need to know how much vinegar to use . you also need to know how big the container you are using to do this in are .
2403	1	additional information you would need to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar you put in the identical cups because without the amount of vinegar stated that results of the experiment wouldn t be accurate nor would you be able to replicate the experiment properly and effectively . also you need to state how much samples or how much of it will go into the containers otherwise the results will not be accurate because you absolutely get the correct mass .
2404	1	the procedure needs to says which samples to use for the experiment because it does not say what to put into the containers . also needs to say how much vinegar to pour in each container . keep trash of dry effect to the substance during the hours .
2405	1	one thing you would need is .
2406	1	after reading the groups information i realized that in order to replicate the experiment they would need to list what materials they needed . they would also need to make their procedure more clear . another important step is to list now much vinegar needs to be put in the containers .
2407	1	some additional information that you would need would be that you would need to know how much vinegar you need because if you were slightly off in all of the containers marble changed and limestone change and wood did not change but if all the vinegar was same in all containers the affect could have varied differently .
2408	1	in the procedure they should state the maximum amount of grams that one would use for this experiment or be able to have all of them be about the same size . for the first part when it says determine the mass they should of really said to mass the objects on a scale . if you were to predict the mass calculations could lead to incorrect data . they also need to state how much vinegar you will be pouring into the containers .
2409	1	this group does not have a list of materials . i would like to know how many people thought this experiment would be accurate or not .
2410	1	additional information fer the student procedure would be the results recorded the difference between each mass and your predict hens .
2411	1	in order to replicate the experiment additional information that i would need is how much vinegar is in each container and whether to use safety goggles are not . i might also would need an conclusion to see what changes they might have changed .
2412	1	the additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is to know which order to do it in end and graph the experiment . .
2413	1	follow directions do everything carefully . connect it right .
2414	1	ok well wood s was the those mass and plastic had the less mass .
2415	1	i would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container are their dropped amount of vinegar going into each container . i would also need to know what was used to measure the samples .
2416	1	we need the groups statement of the problem we have the procedure and the recorded data . we also need the conclusion .
2417	1	after reading the groups procedure additional information you will need to replicate it will be all the materials what to measure their weight in and an exact conclusion .
2418	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to determine the mass of different samples pour vinegar into separate but identical containers determine the mass of each sample .
2419	1	to compete the experiment we would need to know how much vinegar was put into each containers . the size of the container would also be important . other important information would be to have a controlled rock .
2420	1	in order to replicate this experiment many things are needed . the student
2421	1	to replicate this experiment you would need to know what to use to weigh the samples how huge of samples to start with and to put each sample in different containers . you also need to know which kind of samples to use .
2422	1	in order to replicate this experiment we would have to be given an exact amount of vinegar to add to the four operate four identical containers also in order to make a replicate experiment we would have to be given the size of the containers used as well as the dimensions of the four different samples . also it is important to know at what temperature the intervals were kept at for the hours .
2423	1	additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar for each container . i would also need to know the starting mass of each substance . i would also need the exact temperature at which the substances should over the hours duration . all variables are needed in order to have a reliable outcome of the experiment .
2424	1	after reading the groups procedure i would need to know what the samples were how much vinegar to add and what kind of containers they used in order to replicate the experiment .
2425	1	to be able to repeat this experiment i would have to know what samples to use . how much vinegar has to go in each cup . also we need to know how to figure out the mass of each sample .
2426	1	you would need to know how much of each sample to put in the container p you would also need to be told how to determine the mass p you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each sample .
2427	1	after reading the group s procedure i have realized in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the following . i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the containers and how much of the sample to use . i would also have to know how big the containers are .
2428	1	what type are the containers glass plastic
2429	1	what kind of containers are how big were they what were the samples supposed to sit on while they were drying
2430	1	in order to replicate this experiment the students would have to include the different types of stone in their procedure therefore we don t know what their testing . also the students should have given a precise amount of vinegar in each sample otherwise the results may differ . the students should have also done a control experiment to compare their data .
2431	1	some additional information that you need is to weigh the samples before placing them in vinegar . you would also need to know how much vinegar you need to pair in the container . also the name of the samples that you are using would be needed .
2432	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need some more information such as in the directions they should or told ail of the different samples that i was placing in the containers . they should have explained to me bout to determine to mass of the samples . and in the procedure they should have explained to me how much vinegar to pour in each container .
2433	1	plastic after hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water .
2434	1	the information the group could have included is to no the names of the samples the amount of vinegar amount of sample . they also should have included which data to record on this procedure by making the names of the samples . their provided information person knows what they are experimenting on . also the amount of vinegar should be constant and be recorded along with the amount of samples so when the reader compares the data they will understand the difference in mass . the data use should be recorded periodically when the procedure doesn t explain so you can compare numbers after
2435	1	after reading the groups procedure i would add more steps . step would be took organize the materials better . the nd step i would add would be to measure the amount of vinegar that s actually going to go in the cups .
2436	1	after reading the procedure i would need a lot more information to replicate the experiment . i would need to know what the samples were what tools were needed and what the objective of the project was .
2437	1	this group may want to include more specific information like how much vinegar they are going to use . in this procedure they say pour vinegar which is not a specific amount also this group may want to explain how they are going to label their containers . lastly they may want to specify the best way to determine the mass of each sample .
2438	1	i would add a cover to the containers . this is because you never know what might fall into the containers . and if something does fall into the containers then it may affect the results .
2439	1	after reading the groups procedure it would have been good for the group to explain why they chose the materials used why marble limestone wood and plastic . couldn t the group have used some other type of material . also it would have been helpful to know what kind of container and the amount of vinegar .
2440	1	for me to be able to replicate the experiment i would need to know the size of the places of sample that are going into the vinegar . second i would need to know how much vinegar is needed for each ad . third i would need to know the size of the containers that the vinegar and the sample pieces are going to be going into .
2441	1	i would need to know many samples thar are and how much vinegar i would need to pore into each samples .
2442	1	in order to repeat this experiment i would need to have new samples and other stuff . i would need to keep this date .
2443	1	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers . i would also need to know how big the pieces of each sample would be lastly i would need to know how much water to use to rinse the samples off with .
2444	1	to replicate this experiment we would need to know what the group of students used as materials . this procedure doesn t give any measurements of what they are working with how do we know what size to use it says to pour vinegar into the containers but doesn t say how much .
2445	1	additional information that could be added is another trial so the experiment or has something to compare to and to check the validity of the results . also they should state what the samples are in the procedure . another would be stating how much vinegar should be put in the cups and how much the rock is submerged in it .
2446	1	to replicate the experiment i would need to know how to determine the mass of the folly samples and what measurement to use the group never tells what or how they took samples of this is a key piece of information . i would also need to know what to do with the samples after placing them into containers . the group was very vague when writing their procedure and didn t go into enough detail .
2447	1	i would need to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers . i would remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water . then i would allow the samples to sit and dry for minutes to determine the mass of each sample .
2448	1	to replicate
2449	1	the additional information that we would need is really nothing because anything is there .
2450	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar in each sample what kind of samples rock wood etc and lastly how big each sample has to be . if it has more surface area then maybe more will erode .
2451	1	in order to repeat this experiment i would need several additional pieces of information . the first thing i would need to know would be exactly how much vinegar i should put into the containers . secondly i would need to know exactly how much distilled water to use when rinsing the samples . finally i would need to know how much of each sample to use . once i obtain this information i will be able to replicate the experiment .
2452	1	after reading the groups procedure i would need further information in order to replicate the experiment . first of all i would need to know what the sample consists of of what substance it is . second when pouring vinegar into each of the container how much should be poured third i would need to know what type of container i should be using throughout the experiment by small test tubes beakers glass . that is what additional information i feel would be needed if i were to replicate this exact experiment .
2453	1	in order to replicate the procedure there would be more information required p the student should say how much sample to put into a container procedure no . p the student should record number data observations right after they hours . p the student should make said what to label the containers .
2454	1	after reading the group s procedure some additional information that i saw was needed to replicate this experiment were the four types of samples what were they . they never stated in record starting mass and it ending mass .
2455	1	to make this experiment better the group of students would need a control so for steps and use water instead of vinegar . also there should be more trials to test this experiment at least three times to make sure their data is accurate .
2456	1	after leading the groups procedure describe what additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment . make sure to include at least three places or information sample marble ml and out limestone . . and . plate had . . and . .
2457	1	in order to replicate the students procedure on acid rain . we need to know to know additional information about this experiment like how much of each sample we would need and also how many drops of vinegar ana acid rain to put into each container . also one other thing the could add in there procedure is samples of what they don t tell you what your samples are entitle you get down to the table .
2458	1	first you need to find the ending mass and then you need to find the difference in mass . also you need to state which samples you are talking about .
2459	1	to repeat this experiment i would need to know the problem was trying to solve this why a narrow few would be kept . i would also need to know how much vinegar to use in step c . it would also be necessary to know what ti use as samples in step .
2460	1	one additional information is what samples is the student experimenting on two . how much vinegar is place in each container . these what size container is used . these are additional information the student did not include to his procedure .
2461	1	in order to replicate the experiment to see how accurate your results are at the end of procedure number you need to add step number stating that you should repeat step to are or two more times depending on the experiment . also in the chat you can add more information was average mass and total mass for all of the four types of samples .
2462	1	to repeat this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour in each of the four identical containers . does the amount of vinegar vary i would also need to know what materials . in should use samples in should know that the materials are marble limestone wood plastic . lastly i would need to know what unit to measure each sample s mass with . the procedure should let me know to measure the mass in grams .
2463	1	i will need to replicate the experiment . is the three sample is marble limestone wood also containers .
2464	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would also need to know how much ml of vinegar to pour into containers . the steps missing include a step for gathering all needed materials find the starting mass of each sample and find the difference in mass .
2465	1	to complete this experiment they would need to add more steps . the group s never said how much vinegar to add in the containers
2466	1	the groups procedure is very vague . for example in step it says to measure the mass of different samples . the word sample does not clearly tell you to measure the different racks . the same problem is shown in step the procedure says place a sample of one material . . . the problem is that the material could be anything . another problem in this procedure is that the group did not say how much vinegar to put in each cup . you need that as a control .
2467	1	i think the additional information that would needed in order to
2468	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . i would also need to know what kind of balance they used . finally i would need to know how long the containers were to know if the samples should be submerged under the vinegar .
2469	1	detailed explanation of why the experiment is needed . is action temp desired . how is the mass determined
2470	1	to replicate this experiment accurately you would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container . it would also be helpful to know what temperature the vinegar should be when its being placed in the container . you would also need to know what size the sample material is .
2471	1	one clear statement of information is with of them drop the most mass . two did they make sure they check it twice or over again . three was there data correct i think so .
2472	1	i think that because marble . is good a new ending mass g . too .
2473	1	you need to have four different types of mass . to make sure to pour vinegar in for identical containers for each type of mass you have to wait hours until you can drain out the mass from the water then you have let it dry for min . after that you have to determine mass of each sample .
2474	1	you will need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers . you will need to know what kind of containers they are talking about . and mostly you will need to know what the group is testing . and it would also be helpful to know what types of plastics wood limestone and marble to use .
2475	1	quite clearly it is first important that the replicate knows what samples are being used . it should also be established that the four separate identical containers are removed during the second weighing in order to get an accurate mass . it is also important to indicate how much vinegar is being poured over the four samples how it is poured in drops or with a cup and what type of vinegar it is . additionally the environment where the samples are to sit and dry should be specified . is it in sunlight or is it in a darkened room
2476	1	some additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar to pour what do you use to determine the mass of the samples and what type of container should be used plastic glass paper .
2477	1	additional information i would need to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar being poured into the containers to state the names of the different samples in the procedure and the exact size of the single sample . it would also be good to know what container they are using and size of it .
2478	1	some additional information i would need in order to replicate would be after step determine the mass of each sample say that you must find the difference in mass of each sample . another piece of information that is needed is the purpose of the experiment . for example are they trying to find which material had the greatest decrease in mass after the vinegar soaking or the least decrease .
2479	1	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use how large the containers are and how long i should rinse each sample with distilled water . without this information the results of the experiment can be very different than the results of a replica .
2480	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what the four samples were there is no indication of what the samples were until the data table but that is not in the procedure . i would also need to know how much vinegar to add into each container if the amount b constant and also the size of the containers . in addition i would also need to know where the samples were placed what location of the room etc when they sat for hours . i would also need to know what the constant was to make the experiment more valid .
2481	1	. you have to tell how much vinegar you will need to put in each container . p . didn t tell what kind of material ind to needed to put the container . p . do the experiment again to see if the record you got before will be the same .
2482	1	this group s procedure would need additional information if it were to be repeated by another group . the type amount or samples to be used the amount of vinegar to be used on each sample and the location that the samples would be kept in temperature ranges . light etc . are all things that should be included in the procedure .
2483	1	one piece of information that i would need is the temperature of the experiments . how much vinegar would also be necessary i would also need to know what the containers are made of .
2484	1	to replicate this experiment i would need to know what temperature the samples were sitting in and what temperature the distilled water was .
2485	1	this groups procedure is valid but allowing it to replicate will be a problem . by adding multiple trials to the procedure the mass can be averaged allowing he ability to be replicated for example by taking three samples of each material then placing in three differently marked containers you can take the average and then have the ability to replicate it properly
2486	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to include in the procedure what materials you are using specifically not just samples how much vinegar to put in the containers just because the containers are equal doesn t mean that the amount of liquid in them has to be and what conditions they are drying under so that they are all the same to decrease the chance of having more variables .
2487	1	additional information that i would need to copy this experiment is first i need to no how much vinegar needs to go in each container . second i need to know the four different samples of what . last i need to know the four different samples that they have to use in this experiment . these are the things i need to no before i can do this experiment .
2488	1	after reading the procedure of this groups lab there were certain things missing once are the amount of vinegar in each sample . a net mass for each material as included of having from deaf amount have came . doesnt say every date as make a what . rolling about partly . doesnt say what material one used .
2489	1	to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the samples are you would need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers and you would also need to know what kind of temperature to leave the containers in so the experiment works correctly .
2490	1	the additional information i would add to this procedure is first you have to start out with corrections of what materials you need to collect and how much of each without this you will have no idea what samples you are measuring . also the procedure should include a step to get and put on whatever safety materials are necessary such as goggles . the procedure also needs to include how much vinegar you are pouring into the containers is it kept lab you have no idea because they haven t told you . there should also be steps to observe and record your data because that is how you plot a data table . lastly they need a step to clean up their work area .
2491	1	some additional information that i would need to repeat this experiment would be the amount of vinegar that it would need to pour into each of the containers what are the four samples that i am suppose to be testing . after placing the sample into the containers what should i label the containers as and after removing the samples from their containers where should i place them p
2492	1	after reading the procedure we would need to know a bit more information . first of all i would have the samples all be about the same mass . also the procedure should have stated how much vinegar was put into the cases as well as the size of the container . since later on we would like to know the average amount of mass that we lost . we should include multiple trials . this student needed a lot of improvement but it was good now he mentioned hours and min .
2493	1	one piece of information you would need in order to duplicate the experiment is an exact amount of vinegar you should use . also you would need more information on the sample because w o the data table . i wouldn t have known what we were experimenting with . lastly you would need to know what kind and size of container they used .
2494	1	three pieces of information that would need to complete the experiment is one how much vinegar do you put in the cups what is an hypothesis also how much of each substance are you using it is impossible to recreate without at least knowing how much vinegar you are using i ounce or i gallon you can t redo the experiment without it .
2495	1	in order for me to do project and receive the same results i would have to know samples i ll be using how much vinegar to use and what type of scale i would use .
2496	1	in order to do this experiment agile you would have to repeat
2497	1	in order to replicate the lab you would need to know what size the container is . would need to know how much vinegar water was in the container .
2498	1	the additional information you need is the starting mass of the four different samples the ending mass and the difference in mass to replicate the full experiment .
2499	1	same additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to pour into the containers with the sample material . another would be to state what the samples materials are and what they consist of . finally the size of the container along with the temperature of the room in which it will be sitting for hours .
2500	1	the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is where are they gonna put the containers what type of containers what are the single samples for i think that this experiment is gonna be hard to do because they didn t explain the procedure that good .
2501	1	other information i would need to replicate the experience is how much vinegar put into each sample . also i would need to know what samples to use . and the last time i need to know is where do i keep the samples overnight . in sunlight or no sunlight . at room temperature or not at room temperature .
2502	1	the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is measure how much vinegar in each sample you put in and the the container .
2503	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the samples were that were placed into the vinegar . you would also need to know how much vinegar each experiment was placed into as well as you would have to know what type of container you would need .
2504	1	in order to replicate this experiment you should know the acidic level that the vinegar has . you would need to know the starting mass ending mass and the difference between the two .
2505	1	one line that should be number is to grab four separate but identical containers and label them with the name of the rock sample . p another would be after using a triple beam balance record the mass of the samples once again and compare the difference in mass . p another would be in determine the mass of four different rock samples .
2506	1	after reading the procedure the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment would be what four samples i should be testing how much vinegar to put in each container and what kind of container to use . these are important because they would make the results easier to replicate and ensure that i make no errors when reacting the experiment .
2507	1	we would need to know some more things to replicate the experiment . we would need to know what the four different samples are . we would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each and if it is different for different samples . lastly we would need to know what kind of containers to put them in and if we should label them or not .
2508	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers . you would need to know how much of the samples to put in the vinegar lastly you would need to know .
2509	1	you would need double of everything which means you need to have of everything in order to have replicate of the same thing . you need more of the ingredients so that you can make of each .
2510	1	you would need a hypothesis to start the procedure and a independent variable . also a dependent variable and then you would just have to know the steps
2511	1	you would need to know the starting mass of each of the items so you can determine the ending mass . you would also have to know exactly how much vinegar needs to be put in each container because if you put too much vinegar or too little vinegar in the results of the experiment could come out different than the first time because the amount might affect the results . you would also need to know how long to leave the samples in the container of vinegar hours and how long the samples need to sit and dry min .
2512	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need four more different samples vinegar and four separate but identical containers .
2513	1	you would first need to see the mass of the completed experiment . once you what it is replicate the experiment and see if the mass results come out different .
2514	1	you need hypothesis and write what happens after it sits for minutes .
2515	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar is being added to the containers what kind of containers are being used shape size . i would also need to know how much sample of the materials were being added to the vinegar .
2516	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was paired into the containers in the beginning it would also be important to measure the mass of the samples after removing the samples from their containers and before rinsing them . for more accurate results getting the same mass of each material would supply better data .
2517	1	the students should include how much vinegar to pour into each sample of the four building materials . the types of vinegar should be specified as there are many different varieties of vinegar . the students should include what temperature the water should be as well as the conditions of the room and the type of container .
2518	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar added to each container . if you add only a teaspoon and place a sample in it your sample want clean crate as much as a sample drowned in vinegar . also what type of wood would be useful because there are many different types . you would also need to know how many trials they did that way you know if they averaged it .
2519	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the four containers because that could be another factor that you should know if you were repeating the experiment . the temperature has an effect because the four samples are undisturbed for hours . another piece of information you would want to know is a control group to see how much the mass changed .
2520	1	in order to replicate this experiment you are going to need a supply list supplies the procedure and a pen or pencil to record your data . p the supply list will be necessary for when you go to buy the supplies and the supplies are needed to do the experiment . the procedure will be essential so you can replicate the experiment . finally you would need a pen or pencil to record the data to make a chart .
2521	1	after reading this groups procedure in order for me to conduct this experiment i would need more information for example what are the samples i am finding mass for . also i would need to know how much vinegar i would need to pour into the containers . as well i would need to know what to label the different containers so i do not get confused or mix up the containers .
2522	1	you will need to have a hypothesis a statement and and list of what you used for this lab .
2523	1	i would first fix the procedure because it does not give enough information . to determine the mass of the samples we should know the names . it also doesn t clearly state how much vinegar he she pour in . i would also need to know what materials they used a statement of the problem and a hypothesis .
2524	1	in this experiment the additional information i would need i for to know why there is a difference in the mass of all and why didn t they all stop the same like wood also to see which one has an better advantage and a picture or drawing
2525	1	in order to replicate this groups experiment you would need to include where the container was placed for the hours . you would also need to know how big the container that kept the objects in was . they may also want to include how long they rinse the mass for and the temperature at which the masses were kept for the hours . by including this information you could successfully replicate this groups experiment .
2526	1	if i wanted to do this experiment they should have said in the begging to take out all materials and list all included in the experiment also they should have had a cleaning up passes towards the end . it would be difficult to do the experiment without all materials said to be and in the beginning . they also should have put the specific amounts of water that was placed in the beakers .
2527	1	the procedure could be followed but how can we follow it when we don t know what materials to use . the procedure says determine the mass of different samples but we don t know what type of samples to use . we also don t know how much vinegar to use b c if we don t know the right at it might effect the samples . lastly we need to know what units we are using to find the mass of the samples .
2528	1	to fully understand the procedure the reader would need to know what the four different samples when they are the follow of the experiment also what no of vinegar an in loot kind of container leg square cylindrical etc how long should the reader rinse each sample we should be know what they used to measure the mass to ensure accuracy also what marble limestone wood and plastic is a lot of needed p information all of which is measure to carry out an accurate replication of the student experiment .
2529	1	in order to replicate the experiment the procedure given would need to include what are the samples their stating mass whether in the beginning the masses of all samples are equal . also the procedure would also have to include how much vinegar is poured in the containers and weather the amount of vinegar is kept constant . keeping the temperature constant could also increase accuracy as well as performing multiple trials . also the amount of distilled water and type of distilled water should also be added in the procedure to replicate this experiment .
2530	1	in order to replicate this experiment i need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into the samples . au when they say container does it have a lid or where do i put the containers . also they would need to do the experiment with water as a control to help compare the difference .
2531	1	to replicate the groups experiment i would read to know how much vinegar to pour into the cups . i would also need to know how much of each sample to put in each cup and how large the containers need to be .
2532	1	determine the mass of four different sample separates but identical containers .
2533	1	in order to replicate the experiment additional information would include i . e make sure that the amount of vinegar was equal for the four containers and also to be sure that the marble limestone wood and plastic are weighed the same while experimenting .
2534	1	the additional information that i would need to replicate this problem is how much vinegar was put into each cup if all the samples were the same sizes .
2535	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know if you need to cover the samples while they are baking in the vinegar . you would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container . finally you would need to know to know how long to rinse the samples in distilled water for .
2536	1	in this procedure you need more specific information to replicate the experiment . you would need to know how much vinegar is poured into each sample because without knowing that you wouldn t be able to replicate the experiment . you would also have to know what kind of concentration the vinegar has because each vinegar is different which could change your results . you would also need to have all the different samples be the same size because without knowing the size of the materials you wouldn t get the same results .
2537	1	first off they should tell us what the four different samples are . they should tell us how much vinegar to pour in all of the containers . they should tell us what to label each separate container and to put which sample in which container . lastly what you measure the mass of the samples with .
2538	1	you would need to put times down after each material so they were all opened at the same time also you would have to label each material so you would not get each of them mixed up .
2539	1	in order to replicate this experiment there are a few additional pieces of information needed . the first is the amount of vinegar needed in each container you also need to know how much of each sample is necessary . it should also be clear whether or not it is necessary to have the same amount of each sample knowing whether they need to be the same masses or size is crucial .
2540	1	in order to replicate the groups experiment they would need to specify what the four different samples were that were being put into the vinegar . they would also need to tell me about what size piece of cash sample i should use so that they would all be the same . i would also need to know how many ml i should use of the vinegar .
2541	1	the must it how much vinegar they used . they should tell us how big the container should be . they should tell you what to label so you don forget lands mixed up .
2542	1	the group s procedure is missing a couple of steps . first off what samples what are samples . can this be con that need to specify what materials will be used as samples . second they do not tell us to determine the difference between the starting and the ending mass of the objects . and lastly how much vinegar and how much sample should we use . all it says is to pour vinegar into four cups it needs to specify how much vinegar should be poured .
2543	1	a great idea for additional information could be the amount of vinegar that you poured into each samples . the total of mass between the four samples would have helped to . it would ve gave the reader a better understanding .
2544	1	to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in to the samples i would also need to know what the samples are i would also need to know how to rinse the samples .
2545	1	the additional information i would in order to do this experiment is how much vinegar i need to pour into each cup so i can be as precise as possible what type of vinegar they used so the experiment can be the same and what type of containers they used so i can be sure that the experiment is done these .
2546	1	some addition information you would need to produce . this experiment is the knowledge of at what temperature environment the single each sample here consists how much distilled water you must add to the samples and how much vinegar to add to the sample material .
2547	1	to complete the experiment you must know more things to replicate the experiment . first of all you must know how much vinegar is put in each container . you must also know the mass of the container and the amount that each is washed with a distilled container . knowing that information will make doing this lab easy .
2548	1	to replicate this experiment i would advice and use the sample with the most difference in mass to help get mg answer in which one was the best uses .
2549	1	one thing that the group needs to add to the procedure in order to replicate it is how much vinegar they put in it . they also need a control because without a control the test is not red out . they also need to list the size of the container they also need to tell us the temperature they kept to at .
2550	1	for me to repeat this procedure i would need to know how much vinegar do i pour into the four separate containers . i would also need to know how much of each sample i use because it doesn t tell me it just gives the name of the samples .
2551	1	to replicate the experiment i would need to know the ph of the vinegar . i also would need to know what type of plastic and the species of wood that they used in their experiment .
2552	1	there are some things they left out in the procedure one thing was how much vinegar to put into the containers how much of the sample material to put in each container .
2553	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each individual container . you would also need to know if it would be necessary to run a repeat trial as well as where you would store the containers in a hot place cold place separate altogether etc .
2554	1	the student should be more pacific and state the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each container also the student should state how big each container should be another thing the student should state is how long the rocks should be rinsed with distilled water .
2555	1	the additional information i would need is how much vinegar and a more specific explanation of the container then just identical . it would also be helpful if the told us what the different samples were .
2556	1	if you are to planning on doing this experiment you must find out the mass before anything is done than right after . who ever performed this experiment did not weigh the stones out before they were rinsed off . this is critical because you do read this information .
2557	1	some information that i would need would be how much vinegar is put into the containers i would also need to know if the vinegar was cooled or heated or room temp were their separate trials and is this here a table of average masses how acidic was the vinegar will mass of the material affect how fast the vinegar corrodes it
2558	1	you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container . also would need to know what the samples are that you you are experimenting with . then you would need to know the date as you started with the mass because it never said to record the data .
2559	1	in order to replicate this experiment completely you would need to know what the mass was before putting the items in the vinegar you would also need to know how much vinegar is needed in the beakers .
2560	1	. dealing with this lab experiment additional information that i would give would be the name of the material used in each container . . i would explain more of why certain items and or objects was used for example vinegar . besides pouring vinegar in each cup what part did it play in this experiment question like what was vinegar suppose to do . e . t . c . . .
2561	1	the group doing the experiment didn t state the act of vinegar they poured into each rock . therefore there data isn t accurate . this group also did not state a control variable . the reason for the experiment is to compare the results to another rock . they also did not state what kind of water to wash it with . we wouldn t know if the water would affect the rock .
2562	1	in order to replicate the group s experiment i would need some additional information . in step one i need to know what the samples are and how to determine the mass . in step two i must know how much vinegar to pour into each containers . in step three if never dandies that the rock samples are in three same containers as the vinegar .
2563	1	how big the containers should be because the vinegar might absorb more in a more condensed environment . it is also necessary to know how much vinegar is needed in each of the four containers . you would also need to know how big each of the samples should be because the vinegar might absorb more if it is small .
2564	1	in this experiment they need to say what the are putting into the liquids . they also need to say what temp to leave it at . also what they are trying to find out .
2565	1	to replicate this experiment you need to know . p how as the containers should be . p what samples materials do you have the experiment based on . p re mobility of the ending mass . p mass beam balance .
2566	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how to determine the mass of the four different samples . you would also need to know how much of the vinegar and other samples to put in the container . the size of the container is also necessary information in order to accurately replicate the experiment . in the procedure you must also list the four different types of samples that you are going to use in the experiment
2567	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need a problem statement . i don t know what they are trying to figure out . without this knowledge if i do the experiment the data collected will be useless since i wont know how to use it . another piece of information i would need to replicate this experiment is the amount of sample and amount of vinegar . i don t know how much vinegar to put into each cup . also i must set starting weight for the samples . if they are not equal to start out the experiment would have been changed . the last thing i would add is a materials list . this would make it much easier to see what materials i would need for this experiment without it i would have to look for them and place them out of the procedure .
2568	1	you need to be sure that they let it sit for minutes and make sure they left it sit in the vinegar for hours . plus you need they put the same amount of vinegar in all materials .
2569	1	after reading the group s procedure the additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be the starting mass of each sample to be the same weight as the sample in the students data . you would also need to know the ph scale of the distilled water to see if it s an acid or a base . the third piece of additional information would be to contrast or compare it to other forms of acid rain .
2570	1	step one asks to determine the mass of the four samples . they should add what to use to weigh it and list the four samples . in step two they should tell us the amount of vinegar to pour . step three they should ve made the sentence repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container . it s own step .
2571	1	to replicate the students experiment i would need to know what there control was i also would need the dependent and the independent variables . i would need to know the types of cups they used . i also need to know how much vinegar was poured into the cups .
2572	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what samples i was using the starting mass ending mass and the difference in mass .
2573	1	some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment would be what are you sampling how much vinegar to pour and how much of the sample should i put in the container .
2574	1	in order replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was put in the containers at what temperature the experiment was done at and what type of vinegar to use you would need to know this information increase the lab in a controlled manner that these things were not specified in the procedure .
2575	1	additional information i would need to replicate this experiment would be to know a what kind of vinegar that the people used because there are more varieties and brands and to the containers should be identical . how am i supposed to know what type of container they used did they use a graduated cylinder a petra dish also in step number four of the procedure where it says cycle after hours remove the samples from the container rinse with distilled water it should say what temperature of the water and for how long .
2576	1	in order to replicate the experiment one of the things i would need to know is what you are going to use to measure the mass secondly i would need to know after the samples are removed from the containers where they are going to be placed in a separate container . finally another piece of information i would need to know is the formula to find the mass
2577	1	additional pieces information you would need to replicate the experimental stating how you would determine the mass of each sample . state where the samples would sit and dry . and finally state how much vinegar you would use . all of these things will increase the validity of the experiment .
2578	1	in order to properly replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to add to each container . also i would need to know what kind of tool was used to put the samples in and what kind of tool was used to take the samples out . in addition i would need to know what kind of materials were in the four containers also they didn t specify how they determined the masses of each sample . i would need to know what kind of tool they used .
2579	1	one additional piece of information needed is how much vinegar is needed to pour in each of the container s . there is no amount specified and that information is needed another piece of information needed is how much distilled water is used to rinse each sample that amount needs to be stated last information determining how to pour the sample is needed because that method not to be controlled so as not to create water variable .
2580	1	i would need to know the determined mass of each sample . so i could complete the investigation of the and did fain project . i ll need to pour vinegar in each of four separate containers . then place a sample of each material into one container . then after hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water .
2581	1	after reading them group s procedure i would add some additional information to it . first the group should use water as a control to compare with the result of vinegar . second the amount of vinegar added for each sample should be identified and held constantly for each sample . finally the group should also identify the concentration of the vinegar solution . the amount of vinegar and concentration of the vinegar both affect the accuracy of the data
2582	1	you need to know how much vinegar to use . you also need to know what type of vinegar to use because there are many different types . you also need to know the control because we need to know what this is being compared to .
2583	1	the additional information you need to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar being poured into the identical containers the amount of each sample needed how much you would remove each sample from the containers the amount of distilled water needed and where would you place the samples to dry . the procedure should be more specific into their steps .
2584	1	after reading group procedure the additional information i would need to complete the experiment is the the moon of vinegar poured in to each cup also to indeed what each sample i need is in case set not having the data table below and finally what type of containers should the sample be placed into to avoid a chemical reaction .
2585	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar used without the exact p in order to replicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar used without the exact amount of vinegar even with the masses of the samples there is no way to know if you are doing the correct experiment . the amount of vinegar determines how much the mass of the sample would change . so without the amount of vinegar there is no way to replicate the experiment exactly .
2586	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar is used on each sample . also more than one trial of the experiment should be performed in order to get more accurate results . another thing needed would be one of each sample without vinegar to act as a control for the experiment .
2587	1	after reading the steps procedure i still need to know to find the difference in mass make a graph and to record my data in order to reproduce their experiment .
2588	1	you would need more samples of material vinegar and conduct the experiment .
2589	1	after reading the groups procedure i believe that i would need some additional information in order to replicate the experiment for instance the procedure doesn t mention the four samples being used in the experiment they are only pint mentioned in the students data table . also the procedure doesn t tell you how much vinegar needs to be added in the four identical containers . the procedure doesn t mention how much of each sample needs to be placed in the containers . and lastly the procedure doesn t tell me what i should measure the mass of the samples with and how i am supposed to get the differences in mass of the four samples in the experiment .
2590	1	in order to repeat this procedure accurately i would need to know how they measured the samples is grams i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how each cup should be labeled .
2591	1	in the problem it say was could by add and i say safety experiment and a measurement to way the mass .
2592	1	some additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar i should pour into each container . also it should tell us in the procedure that it is required to find the starting mass of the samples . last where should i put the samples when i remove then from the containers .
2593	1	in order to replicate this experiment from the procedures there is more pieces of information i need to know . what are the samples i am putting in the container . how much vinegar am i using . how much of the sample am i putting in the vinegar does the size and surface area have to be the same .
2594	1	the additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is how much of vinegar to pour in the separate containers . also at what temperature should the samples sit at . i need to know if it was warm or cold during the hours to see if it affects the hardening process of samples . lastly how hot or cold does the water have to be to rinse off the sample .
2595	1	the three things you need in the procedure are in i you need to know what to weigh it in grams ours pounds . the second missing piece of information is how much vinegar to pour in each identical container . the last piece of information missing when you rinse the substance how long to rinse them for .
2596	1	this experiment lacks some key information . first of all at no point does it specify the strength at the vinegar which could have an effect on how much degrades . correspondingly the surface area of each object is certainly related to its degradation . the smaller the surface area in relation to its mass the less relative degradation . also the environmental factors certainly play a rate to the desperately .
2597	1	the first thing i would add in the procedure is what kind of containers . then a control for the experiment the finally i would add more trials .
2598	1	to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how big the samples should be in size . also you would need to know what kind of wood or plastic you are testing .
2599	1	the additional information i would put in the procedure is the amount of vinegar you put in the container . p there also should be a container with no material in it just as a reference for the graph . am also when they put it into a single container they didn t specify if they were sitting in the containers in the time they were placed for minutes .
2600	1	if given only the information in the procedure i would still need to know what material the four samples should be if the kind of vinegar matters and any additional necessary materials to do the experiment .
2601	1	to replicate this experiment much more information would be needed . the first thing they would need to add is the type of rats and their starting mass which needs to be held constant . the rd thing is the amount of vinegar used and the rd is the size of the cup . all this information is vital in re crating this experiment .
2602	1	in order to replicate the groups experiment i would need to know what kind of container to use . if the containers should be sealed what temperature should the samples remain at during the hour period and for the procedure to be more specific in general .
2603	1	to replicate this experiment you would need to add more sample to experiment with you would also need additional containers to place the sample in and you would need more vinegar to pour in the containers . if you were to replicate this experiment the materials needed would have to be added to determine the mass of the samples . for replicating the experiment you may also add different materials to determine the differences of the masses .
2604	1	the information that is needed to complete the experiment is to tell what kind of rock samples are they using . also there needs to be a constant amount of vinegar in each container . they didn t say had much vinegar to use . after hours there was no specification on how long to rinse the samples .
2605	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need vinegar into four separate but identical containers . you would place a sample of one material into one container and label repeat with remaining samples after hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water . let it sit and dry for minutes . for additional information we would need to know why the group of students would come to find the mass of the different samples .
2606	1	i would include the amount of vinegar put into each container because that could have an effect on the overall outcome . i would also include the names of the samples because how would you know what to place into the container . after that i would say how much of each sample i would put in the container because the amounts could change the outcome .
2607	1	some additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in each container what the size of each sample would be and how many trials should be performed for each materials .
2608	1	to complete anna replicate the student s experimental procedure i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in container . if i do not there will be different amounts which will change the result . i would also need to know how long to rinse each sample for in how much distilled water . finally i would need to know how to determine the mass of each sample .
2609	1	i would need to know how much vinegar to poor into each container . also how long to rinse it . also how big the samples would need to be .
2610	1	in order to replicate this experiment . i would need to know what the sample are how much vinegar to pour in the containers and what kind of container to put the samples in .
2611	1	in order to be able to replicate this lab i would need to know the exact amount of vinegar . i would also need to know what temperature the distilled water should be as well as how many trials they did pulley trials gives more accurate answers .
2612	1	i would need to know what four different samples to use in step . also i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup in step and also how much of the materials to put in the containers in step .
2613	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of samples you will be using . you need to know to use marble limestone wood and plastic . you also need to know how much vinegar to pour in so that all the samples have the same exposure and the experiment is not tainted or flowed . the students could also state what kind of containers to use a graduated cylinder a beaker or something else . saying you need a container is very vague .
2614	1	in order for me to complete this experiment i will need to know what the samples are . i am going to need to know what we are quit with . i will also need to have a controlled variable .
2615	1	marble . p limestone . p wood . p plastic .
2616	1	in order to replicate this experiment you need to have a controlled variable you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the cups . you also need to know how much water you use to rinse with .
2617	1	to replicate the experiment you would need to know what each of the four materials were in the procedure . you would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how long the material should be rinsed for after hours .
2618	1	any additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment of acid rain would be the reliability of what this procedure would of been affected on by the independent variable . i know that the independent variable is the samples the dependent variable is the mass change so how was the temperature during this experiment
2619	1	. how would i determine the mass of each sample . p .
2620	1	get the mass of four different samples and pour the vinegar in each . after hours you remove samples and rinse with water . let dry for minutes and then determine mass again .
2621	1	to replicate this experiment you would need some additional information . first you would need to know the amount of vinegar in the cup . you must also know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water . another faster you must know is the ph level of the vinegar
2622	1	to replicate this experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container . if i don t know the amount of vinegar then i won t keep the experiment constant with any results . i would also need to to know the whole procedure including the safety tips .
2623	1	in order to replicate this experiment the additional information need would be to give specific ailments of vinegar to put in each container .
2624	1	to replicate the experiment the group should include measurements for how much vinegar should be used . this will give the person replicating the experiment a greater understanding of what to use .
2625	1	in order to replicate this experiment i will first need all of the lab materials used i will also need a balance to record the show mass and finding mass . finally i will need a calculator to find the difference of the mass . this experiment was the observation and math that i think with their three pieces i would replicate to the experiment .
2626	1	i would need to know what samples to use . how should i measure the samples
2627	1	in order to replicate the missing data then the students would need to tell us how much vinegar they used in the cups . also they need to tell us how much water they used . and lastly they need to tell us what environment to let the samples dry in . this is what i need to be able to repeat the experiment .
2628	1	first they need to say what materials they need to do the experiment limestone marble . . . . . . . . also the procedure needs to be clearer and they need to explain the removing process a little more . also they do not tell you how much vinegar you need to pour in .
2629	1	other information would be what measurements in the cups how much distilled water do you rinse with and how to determine the samples .
2630	1	in order to replicate the group s experiment there would be several pieces of information p you would need to know . first you would need to know which device you would need to use to measure the mass of the samples and which samples you would need to use . also you would need to know how much vinegar was needed to be poured into the containers . finally you would also need to know how much distilled water you should use to rinse each sample for how long you should rinse it for and at what temperature the water should be at .
2631	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know a conclusion how long it took for the sample to dry and how you get the for different samples .
2632	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what kind of vinegar they us what temperature the samples were stored at and what size the contained was .
2633	1	first thing you would do is the control of the procedure . the next thing you would need to know is all of the different samples .
2634	1	the additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed in each of the containers . also you would need to know how much distilled water to use . the procedure also does not say whether or not the samples such as marble limestone wood and plastic should all be the same mass .
2635	1	to make a replica of this experiment i would need to know which kind of samples are needed and then how much of each sample is needed to be placed in each container . then i would also need to know how much vinegar would be needed to pour into each container when removing the samples to sit and dry while is this supposed to hopping on a table under a light etc . that information would need to be included for this experiment to be carpeted .
2636	1	the additional information that you ll need in order to replicate the experiment is that you ll need the procedure in order to figure out th starting mass ending mass and the difference in mass . for each sample their starting ending and difference in mass are all different .
2637	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need a scale to measure the four different samples a given amount of vinegar to pour in each container labels for each container and an amount of time to rinse each sample with the distilled water .
2638	1	additional information needed would be the exact amount of vinegar whose the samples are placed to dry and how long to rinse each sample .
2639	1	the additional information i would need to replicate this lab would be p . the amount of vinegar used . p . the vessel used to hold the samples because it might burn a normal cup . p . how to dry them because they might have used a different method than i might employ . p . materials list to know how much of everything rocks vinegar .
2640	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar to use also you would need to know the what types of materials to use in the experiment and you would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples .
2641	1	one piece of additional information one would need to know is how are you supposed to determine the mass . there are many different ways to determine this . another piece of information unknown to the cover is how much vinegar one is supposed to use in the experiment . finally you would need to know what size the samples need to be .
2642	1	the students procedure was very vague . the first thing they should it done was in list all the materials that were required for the experiment . also they say to determine the mass of each sample but they must include how to get the mass so it is accurate and time the experiment is performed . the procedure is also very vague when it talks about during a sample of one material into a container . i do not know list that material s .
2643	1	starting in number they didn t tell me how much vinegar to pour into a container they didn t tell me what type of container either . they also didn t tell me what unit of measure to weigh the rocks either .
2644	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need specific amounts measurements and labels of the material involved . i would need to know the specific amount of vinegar poured into each container . i would need one material which would result as my control and i would probably need to know what the mass of each identified material was before i rinsed it with distilled water .
2645	1	the additional information needed is the name of each of the four samples how you should weigh the samples and how much vinegar should be put into the containers .
2646	1	additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is to be poured into the containers what thing of samples are needed how to label the containers that the samples and vinegar in it and what kinds of things are needed for the control .
2647	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each container . they also never tell you what you need samples of to use during the experiment . lastly it is never mentioned to record your data or what materials are used thought the experiment .
2648	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar is needed . i would also need to know what to use to weigh the mass of each item .
2649	1	the additional information that i would need in order to complete this experiment would be how much vinegar was poured into each of the four containers . also you would need to give the direction to determine what using the four different samples were for each of the cups . lastly you would need to accurately determine which was the control in the experiment and to tell the difference in two masses .
2650	1	in this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add . if you place it in sun or shade and . and where you need the containers as .
2651	1	the group forgot to include how much vinegar to pour into the cups . they also did not say what to label the cups after you are finished .
2652	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know why you need to know the mass of four different samples . what are you trying to do with that information . also you would need to know how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples you also need to know if the water you need to rinse the samples with should be cold or hot .
2653	1	they did not give you a by information signs in what temperature we should keep the it in they also didn t tell you how much vinegar to pour in . another key information they didn t give us is what is the sample .
2654	1	you would need the amount of vinegar poured into the container to make sure it was equal . you d also need a supplies list so you know a need of time what you need . another thing you d need to know was where to keep the samples ie room temperature in the dark etc
2655	1	the additional information i would add would be the amount of vinegar needed . how big of a piece of sample to use and how big of a clip that is needed .
2656	1	in the third step of the procedure it does not clarify what material you are putting into the containers also it does not explain what you are supposed to label the containers and why . it just says label it also doesn t say what type of containers to use and how much vinegar should be poured .
2657	1	how to determine the mass .
2658	1	after reading the procedure i would need three additional pieces of information to replicate this experiment . i would need to know the amount of vinegar added to each container what kind of container to use and the type of samples to use .
2659	1	the procedure would need to identify the samples and how much vinegar have .
2660	1	three additional pieces of information you would need in order to replicate this experiment are whet to weigh the mass has how much vinegar to put in the cup and how big the a sample is .
2661	1	this additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar you pour into each container another additional information you would need is the same measuring scale that you weigh each sample an you also should know what kin d of container to use and about how much of each sample to test .
2662	1	the information i would add to this procedure is what the samples are . although the data table shows them . if we didn t have the table we wouldn t know what we re testing . i would add able limestone wood and plastic instead of just repeating samples .
2663	1	in order to replicate this experiment the students should . specify the amount of vinegar to be added to the sample . . each sample should have the same starting mass and . specify what kind of conditions to let them sit the hours in .
2664	1	they didn t include how much vinegar they poured in each sample cup . how would they measure the mass
2665	1	for this experiment the students should state what kind of materials in the procedure before collecting the data and putting of on a table . also get more of the same materials so you can test them on different times . and also the students should lengthen their time on the experiment .
2666	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know the size of the samples . the surface area varies depending on the size . in order to replicate this experiment i need to have the same surface area . i would need to know the amount of vinegar poured over the rocks . if the then the replicated experiment would not be the same . i would also need to know about the environment the containers are kept at such as the temperature and whether or not light is exposed to the containers .
2667	1	the additional information i would need to replicate this procedure is what the samples are what to use to weigh each sample and what to label the samples as on the container .
2668	1	you will need all the met earls to replicate this experiment like the samples marble limestone wood and plastic . and a scale to determine the mass before and after your experiment . and allow all the samples to sit and dry for the full minutes . then weight all the samples according to the mass .
2669	1	you would still need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container how much water you should use to rinse the sample for . you also need to know if you are working just at the procedure what samples you would need to acquire .
2670	1	the procedure didn t state how much vinegar was needed to pour into each container . it also doesn t say what to label the container . the procedure also does not say how long to rinse the sample . all of these can change the data of the experiment if they are not all the same stated in the procedure .
2671	1	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the ph the vinegar because the ph of y different vinegar may vary . and i would need to know the approximate shape of the samples because if the limestone for example has a greater surface area then it would corrode faster because more of its surface is touching the vinegar . also i would want to know if the vinegar covers the sample completely in all three containers or not because if a stone is only half covered by vinegar it does not horror as fast as a stone covered completely by vinegar .
2672	1	this is a good procedure because they are keeping track of their process that they get . at the starting mass marble . ending . difference in mass . . starting mass limestone . ending mass . difference in mass . . all they are doing is keeping track of the process they get .
2673	1	an additional piece of information would be how much vinegar to pour into the sample containers . it would be helpful the scientist to know which unit to measure the mass in kg g mg and in step y . the time needed to rinse the samples would be needed because the rinsing time could affect the results .
2674	1	to replicate this groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you should pour into each container . you would also need to know what types of containers to use before that and after the experiment . you would also need to know what size the samples should be .
2675	1	after i read the produce i came upon the conclusion of getting another sample natural to replicate this experiment .
2676	1	i would need to know what the containers were made of . what was the ph of the vinegar was and how many trials to each sample were performed .
2677	1	one thing you would need to know is what are the four different samples that we should use . another you need to know to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to pour in each container . the last piece of information you might need to know is how to find the mass . in step of the procedure they should have mentioned using a triple beam balance scale or the type of scale they used . without your experiment could be very different from theirs .
2678	1	after reading the group s procedure some additional information they would need to put in in order to replicate the experiment is firstly what sort of container do you put the substance in to . secondly instead of saying placing a single sample they should tell us a specific amount to put in each container . next in step be more specific about the directions concerning the vinegar and lastly they should tell us what the different samples are of course .
2679	1	one piece of information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar volume in each container . another piece of information i would need would be the temperature of the vinegar . for example if the vinegar was warm it could cause the materials to decrease in mass more rapidly . lastly i would need to know the size of the four different containers . it would also help to know what materials those containers were made out of .
2680	1	to replicate the experiment additional information that would be needed is to determine the mass in grams the type of sample and the type of containers would all have to be identical .
2681	1	one of the information needed at the beginning of the procedure is what are the four different materials we are dealing with . they also should have told if it was at room temperature . they did not say in the procedure if the container should be left in clear airy space or if it should be in a dark place .
2682	1	the additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is to know how much vinegar to pour in each containers what the samples are that i m testing and what do i weigh the stones on to get their mass .
2683	1	it would need to say in the procedures to have the starting mass . it would need to say what these samples are . the procedure would also have to include that the students have to find the differences in the masses .
2684	1	the three piece of information i would need to know in order to replicate the experiment are as follows the amount of each sample ex . how much marble the amount of vinegar to immerse the samples and vinegar should be kept in ex room temperature
2685	1	i think the information you would need to replicate experiment is the starting facts .
2686	1	after reading this groups procedure they need to tell me what kind of samples stone . they also needed to tell me to take the mass of the samples before placing it with the vinegar . lastly if the group told me to do more than one trial the information would be more valid .
2687	1	if you were going to replicate it you would do the exact same steps but i would probably use four other samples and use something else instead of vinegar and i would probably have it be hours not .
2688	1	first i would need to know how much vinegar was in each container then i would need to know the size of the container . i would also have to know what kind of samples they used .
2689	1	the additional information that i would add is which one has the most mass and which one has the least mass and have a conclusion to the experiment .
2690	1	you would also have to include the type of sample what the temperature should be what do you do with the samples after the minutes and how many trials this experiment should include .
2691	1	. how much vinegar do you need to pour in . p . how large of a container is it . p . how long can you rinse the sample of water for .
2692	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of container the materials we put into . also what was the labor temperature at which the samples was done .
2693	1	after reading the groups procedure four pieces of additional information that must be added to replicate the experiment are the names of the four samples the size of the containers the amount of vinegar used for each sample and there must be a control .
2694	1	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container also what kind of vinegar to put into the container .
2695	1	first i would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container . also we would need to know what material the containers should be made of because if we use plastic containers the substance could be affected the same way the sample materials are . lastly the procedure written by the students does not tell us what to use to remove the samples from the container nor does it place an amount of distilled water to use when rinsing the samples .
2696	1	i believed that i would need the controlled variable independent variable and the dependent variable . because if you don t have these three thing their investigation not going to come at how they expect it . that the three thing most important when you doing an experiment or investigation .
2697	1	you would need to know how big the containers are . if you need to dry it in a cool or dry area and how much vinegar you need to put in each container
2698	1	some additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment is you could leave the sample in for longer period of time . you could allow the sample to dry for longer period of time because some of the samples take longer to dry than others . such as what it is harder to dry than marbles you can also try putting each samples in the same container and see what would happen .
2699	1	there need to be a part that says how much vinegar is to be put in each containers . how much of a sample to put in the vinegar and the experiment should say what the samples being tested are .
2700	1	if had to make a replicate of this experiment some additional information would had been . how much vinegar to add in each container and how much mass every sample they all would read the same amount .
2701	1	one additional information would be to know what the four different samples were . another way for the information to be clear would be to tell how you going to measure the mass . lastly it shouldnt be contains you should know much of the different sample are in the contains . if it likes a graduated cylinder or something different .
2702	1	if i were to duplicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into each cup . without knowing how much vinegar to put into the cups the out comes would turn out very different .
2703	1	what could have been done is the should have told me how much vinegar they put because what if they filled the glass on and i only put tablespoon the result will not be the same . and the third step is not clean shouldn t there be an experiment involve like water because may be when samples have into content with a liquid that has changes .
2704	1	what i think should be additional to this procedure is see how they came out and looked . p the th part of the procedure see how the starting masses came out the ending mass and the difference in mass . p also find out the averages of each sample .
2705	1	you would need to gets the materials the samples of morale limestone wood and plastic vinegar and containers and step record your results and also make a hypothesis before you start doing any thing .
2706	1	additional information that can be added is a control to see if any thing will happen to a certain rock without rinsing it or putting it in the acid rain in for a different time . also you can use at least one other sample of stone . the procedure can also include to have the person write a hypothesis or a safety guide .
2707	1	we must know how much vinegar is being put into containers to keep it consistent . we must make the surface areas of the samples equal . we must make sure the containers are the same material .
2708	1	the composite in of the sample amount of each sample amount of vinegar to be poured .
2709	1	the procedure is missing a vital step . they need to write out how much vinegar they use for each sample . the amount should be the same used for all samples .
2710	1	first you would need to know the quantity of vinegar needed . that measurement is not given and is essential to the experiment . furthermore the type of container is not given for instance should the vinegar be poured into a flask or beaker finally it does not say where to leave the container for the hours . there could be a large difference in the out come if the container are left in a warm environment instead of a cold one .
2711	1	in order to replicate this experiment you must pour vinegar in each of the four identical containers . other trials so you can see if you get the same results for each sample . then you can average if you get different results . have a control group and just ran distilled water with vinegar so you can compare the results with vinegar so you can compare the results with sample that have vinegar with them .
2712	1	they did not tell at what temperature the rock were in . they did not tell us how much vinegar was in each of the containers . they did not tell how long to leave the rock in the vinegar .
2713	1	in order to replicate the experiment we would need to know what materials to use the procedure says place a sample of one material . but it never specifies what kind of material to use .
2714	1	i think you also need to know how much time it took for each sample to perverse in mass .
2715	1	to be able to replicate this procedure you would need to include what types of samples you need how much vinegar to use in each sample you would also need to include what type of container you should use .
2716	1	the thing you would need is what to use for your four samples . they should also say what to use as containers . the procedure should also tell you what to label them and if there is a control .
2717	1	the students also should shake how much vinegar to use and where its lease the container such as on a window on in the floor .
2718	1	the group would need to include the different types of samples that they want you to weigh . you also need the amount of vinegar to put into the containers the units of weighing needs to be included also to determine the mass before after the vinegar .
2719	1	in order to replicate this experiment in a more effective way you would need to state the materials you are testing in the procedure establish as exact orient of vinegar and chair the size of each container .
2720	1	after reading the groups procedure describe what additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment . make sure to include list three pieces of information . i believe they add the time differences and that s it .
2721	1	additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should i use what size should the container i use be what sample should be used .
2722	1	the group should include finding the difference in mass in the procedure since it s part of the data table . they also should ve weighed the samples before they let it dry because weight could ve been affected by the drying process .
2723	1	the additional information you would need for this is how much of the materials you would need . the measurements and what exactly you are trying to figure out in the experiment . to replicate this experiment you would need vinegar in four separate containers . the samples that you are going to place inside . marble limestone wood plastic .
2724	1	the students should have added in number what king of samples they were weighing . they should have also added how much vinegar to put in the separate containers . in between number and number the students should have added to record the mass on data table and after number they should have done the same thing too .
2725	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour how much of each sample to pour what are the four different samples where would i place the removed samples and the specific materials i would need .
2726	1	to replicate this work you would need to know what four samples they used in this case marble limestone wood and plastic . you also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container . also you have to weigh the samples before putting them in the vinegar you would need to know thees three things before you could replicate the experiment .
2727	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to have more containers present . then you would need more materials to put into the containers . now lastly you would have to have the experiment go on for another hours in order to see if your results come out differently .
2728	1	the additional information is that we need to do in order and put very tearfully because the containers can broke and the them other hours we need to do all process very careful because something can go bad
2729	1	the first thing you would need to know in order to replicate the experiment would be what the four different samples are . another would be a list what materials you would need also what kind of containers to put them in and last where to keep them over the hours .
2730	1	. measure the same amount of different samples that are marble limestone wood and plastic p . in four different but identical containers put the same amount of vinegar . p . place a sample of one material in each container and label them . p . repeat step number for each sample . p . leave the samples in a dry place for hours . p . after the hours let the samples dry for about min and then measure them .
2731	1	how much vinegar i needed to put in the containers and what kind of containers and how much stone must be used .
2732	1	in order to replicate this experiment you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and what the four masses are .
2733	1	the additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is to tell what the four samples are in the statements . if we don t know what the samples are we can t do this experiment . they should ve also included how much vinegar to use because it can affect the experiment .
2734	1	i would just replicate the procedure in order to replicate the students work .
2735	1	additional information that would be needed to repeat this groups procedure would be the four different sample materials what the mass of the materials would be and how much vinegar to add to each container .
2736	1	limestone . . . . p marble . . . . . p plastic . . p wood . p i think the wood is the smallest because the difference in mass e was only .
2737	1	in order to replicate this experiment by reading the procedure you will need to know how much vinegar is in each containers what samples the group used and how much distilled water was used to rinse off the samples .
2738	1	the other additional information that i that it needs to be added is the amount of vinegar that was added to each sample . also if they added water to the vinegar were the sample was .
2739	1	you would need what four samples they were testing the amount of vinegar needed and what temperature the containers need tone kept in order to replicate this experiment .
2740	1	the information on in this procedure is not clearly stated . to replicate the experiment the group needed to repeat what they did the group also didn t list the four things being tested in the procedure . the students did not state what was in control .
2741	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they poured
2742	1	some additional information that can be added is of measuring time intervals . you could leave each of the materials in the containers longer than hour like . you can see a larger difference in mass then . another thing you could do is choose different materials other than the ones shown . one other thing you could change is the amount of time the samples sit and dry for as well as perhaps using a different liquid other than vinegar . this way you could determine if by using a different liquid a difference in mass would be shown .
2743	1	after reading the group s procedure i would need at least three pieces of information in order to replicate that experiment . i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers what samples to use i . e what samples they used only looking at the procedure and not the data size of the containers they used . i would also have a control using just water and more trials . p answered question how it read because it asked after reading the procedure and not after reading the data table .
2744	1	in the procedure they need to determine what the samples are also they need to tell you ax erectly how much vinegar and rock to put in . if there is to rock the vinegar won t break it down . it should say in the procedure either to us grams or kg .
2745	1	some additional information that you need in order to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar you pour in each cup because if the disdain amount relic cums are inaccurate . also how much water or how long do you need to rinse each object . also for the experiment you need to use the same type of vinegar the size of each cup and the exact minutes shown .
2746	1	to replicate this experiment they need to tell us the control . and list all the things that need to be kept constant like amount of vinegar type of vinegar the size of the cups .
2747	1	you would need to include what you measured the mass with . what kind of states were used and the last were of information what kind of vinegar was used when doing the experiment .
2748	1	additional information that you would need to know if you wanted to replicate this expire mint is how much vinegar to pour into the samples how long you should rinse each sample with distilled water and what are these different samples also .
2749	1	you would also need to know how much of each sample they used how much vinegar they used how much distilled water they used and how much light was used on them to dry in order to replicate the experiment .
2750	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what it is the group is looking for why they were doing the experiment the amount of vinegar that is to be poured onto the substances what kind of containers to use and weather or not the samples needed to be capered while sitting in vinegar or not .
2751	1	to replicate the students experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use what size container to put the samples in and where i should do the experiment . each of these would drastically change the outcome of the experiment . for example if there was more vinegar in one container that sample would have more nods .
2752	1	additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be the types of materials used . they are not stated in the procedure . it would also be ideal to have the amount of concentration of vinegar in each container . the location of the containers is also important . the effect that the vinegar has may be different in different temperatures . the procedure should also determine to what decimal place the mass should be taken .
2753	1	the additional information that they would need is how big was the containers because it said that they pour vinegar into the container and left . hover night they also needed it to add on where did they all it over night because was left somewhere for hours . how did they determine the mass in the first place because they never said that they use anything to determine the mass in the beginning and end .
2754	1	to replicate the experiment you would need to indicate the amount of vinegar needed what temperature is needed and what safety requirement is necessary . also what the purpose of the experiment is .
2755	1	we have to know all about how the mass change in marble the starting mass is the . but ending mass is . the difference in mass . we need to know how that happen how the mass change how mach time the mass take for change but limestone starting mass . ending mass . difference . the question is how that happen why because the visage go into the nuclei of the morsel or affect at moss of the morsel limestone wood plastic the .
2756	1	in order to repeat this experiment it is necessary to know how much vinegar is put into each container . also the size and the shape of the container is needed . additional it is important to know the exact ph of the vinegar being used . finally it is important to know the size and shape of each material sample . each of these would greatly affect the results .
2757	1	additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment you need to know how much vinegar should be placed into the four identical containers you need to make sure you remove the sample materials from each container at the same time and how much distilled water should be used to rise each sample .
2758	1	in order to replicate the experiment one must first be more specific with the explaining in their experiment . they should list the tools they used for each variable . also the students should be more clear with their steps . they need to more accurate with all of their data .
2759	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers you would also need to know how the different samples are that you are measuring the last peace of information needed is what materials are being used in the containers .
2760	1	the additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment what the four samples are wear safety protection and keep a data chart of the starting and ending mass and difference in mass .
2761	1	you need to know the specific amount of the sample you have in order to duplicate the experiment and the condition that they performed the experiment . examples temp is the room and of air pressure . you also need to know the materials included in this experiment .
2762	1	well first of all it doesn t tell you how much vinegar to put into each . cup you also need to know what materials we will need for the experiment . as well as how much water to use so it deposit effect weight .
2763	1	additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be have my samples as marble limestone wood plastic all labeled so i would now which was added the amount of vinegar . another additional information would be test each one twice list to be sure and reliable enough for each sample .
2764	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what the control is . also i would want to know if all the samples should have the same starting mass . lastly i would want to know how many trials to do .
2765	1	to replicate the experiment you would have to find new samples to put in the vinegar you would also have to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar into the cups but to change it little you could use a different kind of cup .
2766	1	after reading the procedure
2767	1	to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and how i was to determine the mass of each sample .
2768	1	you would need a hypothesis
2769	1	they didn t specify the amount of vinegar they put in each cup . they didn t say what temperature they kept each cup at . they didn t say how much of each sample they put in the cup either .
2770	1	in order to replicate the experiment i would need some constants what stays the same and a control . i would also need to know how to determine the mass of each samples and i would need o know where to put the samples in a cold or warm environment in the sunlight or darkness
2771	1	in the procedure you would need to include what four types of samples and their weight . also you will need to know how much vinegar to add into the containers and what type of a container those are included for this experiment .
2772	1	to replicate the experiment you would need to know what tools they used . also what the temperature was . finally they need to tell you how much vinegar to use .
2773	1	to replicate this experiment i would need to know what amount of material was used in the vinegar how much vinegar was used and at what temperature this samples were stored at .
2774	1	in the first step describe how to find the mass same with the last step .
2775	1	in the procedures it stated place a material into one container and label should have listed the materials being used and write what happened over one day while the experiment was in affect .
2776	1	i order to replicate this experiment you would need another set of materials .
2777	1	i can t know
2778	1	in this experiment you need to know how much vinegar you need to use .
2779	1	the student s data recorded on the table is not enough to properly replicate the experiment . the table shows only the mass of the different materials but it should show other important pieces of data as well . the table should include how much vinegar was put into the containers what type of container is being used how long the samples sat in the vinegar and how long they were set to dry .
2780	1	in order to replicate the experiment there is a list of additional information needed in the group procedure to start we would need to know to determine the mass so a sample in the procedure it should sing to art a triple bean bean balance and describe steps for calculating the mass . also in order to complete it experiment would need to know the far different samples bring used . next the procedure should include how much vinegar and the amount of each sample should be poured on container . finally it would be helpful if we keep when and a containers and sting us in the experiment and where should would place that experiment to allow them to dry priority .
2781	1	in order to be able to ampere this experiment you need to know how much vinegar you need to put into the containers a second piece of information you need to know to what type of container to use i . e glass or plastic a third piece of information measure for this experiment is how kg each sample should be .
2782	1	this procedure is very vague . first of all all they say is four different samples and then they don t even say what the samples are or what of . also they didn t say how much vinegar to put in . in order to replicate the experiment i need this information .
2783	1	the three pieces of information left out of these experiment instructions are as follows first what materials the samples are second how much vinegar should be poured into each container and third in what way should the samples be removed .
2784	1	the additional information needed to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar do we need to use how much of each material and what are the materials . without knowing how much vinegar it couldn t be accurate because not every container would have the same amount same with the materials . and the group doesn t list the materials in the procedure what kind of tools we need to know .
2785	1	i would need the time when this experiment was prefer and when it was done . also
2786	1	one piece of information needed to replicate this take is the amount of vinegar added to each containers . another piece of information necessary is how much distilled water to rinse the samples with . finally you need to know where the samples should sit to dry . without these pieces of information you cannot react the procedure .
2787	1	the main piece information is what type of vinegar and how each of it . how much water should each sample to be rinsed with . also it was never mentioned what the sample should be . in the instances you can tell that one needs marble limestone wood and plastic by looking on the data table .
4492	2	they could of improved to remove the weights and clamp and measure the length of the plastic types .
4493	2	in conclusion the student found that the plastic types did stretch out considerably . plastic stretched the most increasing in length mm while plastic a stretched the least with mm . i think that the student should have included the original length of the plastic in data table included the original length of the plastic in the data table . this would give a better idea of what the test piece looked like and would help reader understand the experiment more another thing the student could have done was do more trials . in both trials conducted the amount the plastic stretched had changed so more trials make it clearer .
4494	2	a . based on the student s data plastic type b was the stretchiest because it stretched the most amount . p b . are why to improve the experiment would be to make all the plastics the same length so they can be compared easier . another improvement would be to add the same amount of weights to each plastic . if they were different it would affect how much the plastic stretched .
4495	2	a plastic type a t increased by t plastic type b t decreased by t . plastic type c t decreased by t plastic type d t stayed neutral as t . p b the students could ve improved their results if they let the clamps with weights on it to hang more than minutes .
4496	2	a based on the data plastic type b has the most stretchability . t mm t mm . plastic a only stretched t mm t mm . plastic t mm t mm . plastic d t m t mm . plastic b stretched the most each trial and even attached mm more from the t to t . b the student could have improved the experimental design by saying how many weights will clamp on to each plastic and what you measure the length with .
4497	2	a in conclusion it was plastic type b that stretched most reaching an average length of . mm . plastic type a however didn t fare as well and stretched to an average length of mm . plastic d managed to stretch to mm and plastic type c was elongated to about . mm . p b two ways the student could have improve the the conclusion of the experiment and the validity of the results would have been by dictating a specific length that each polymer should begin as and add a column to the data table saying what the change in length was for each plastic type .
4498	2	in the polymer investigation the type of plastic that stretched the most is plastic type b with a whole mm and on first trial beating types a c d with the most stretched and in nd trial stretching mm . this ways the students could have improved the experimental design is that they could have the plastic before being stretched .
4499	2	from the data collected during this lab it is evident that plastic type b d are very similar in strength and are not too compact . plastic types a c however are similar in strength and very resistant to physical force . this lab could be improved simply bye standard rising both the length on the plastic before testing and the weights applied to them .
4500	2	the conclusion that has been very noticeable is plastic type b had the most stretchable . polymer plastic with trial t having mm and trial t having mm .
4501	2	plastic d has the most stretchability and stayed the same for trial one and two . plastic a has the least . the student could have did at least two or more trials and could of add another plastic type .
4502	2	a polymer b can stretch th most in trial it stretched mm and in t mm . the least stretchable was polymer a stretching cm d mm in trials and respectively . p b the students could ve improved their experiment by first being specific about how much weight should be attached to the polymers . next they should measured the plastic under tension because after the tendon is released it can insert etch
4503	2	my conclusions based on this experiment . is that plastics a and b are the strongest plastics since they endured more than the other two bags . two ways these kids could have improved their experiment is that they could have given extra length to the tape and they also could ve increase their experiment to a trial .
4504	2	a based on my data my conclusion would be that b would be the material that stretches the most . p b student should always test experiment at least times the procedure should of shown more detail like the weight amount they used or even what type of plastic material they used .
4505	2	a in my conclusion when i stretched the plastic with the weights the stretchiest plastic was type b . the firmest plastic trial stretched the least was type a . p b the student should have included a statement problem because it was unclear in the purpose of this experiment . in step the student should make the instruction more clear . for instance they could have said something like repeat steps for the remaining three plastics .
4506	2	in conclusion based upon the students data between trial and there has become a pattern for each a b c d . the numbers go lower to high back to low and back up once more to high . for example trial it goes a b c and d . for trial it goes a b c and d .
4507	2	the conclusion based on the students data is that plastics a and b show an increase in the amount stretched between two trials while plastics c and d show no increase in the amount stretched two trials . two ways that the student could have improved the experiment is by identifying the type of plastic that he was testing as well as conducting more trials to improve validity .
4508	2	a based off the students data plastic type b was the one that was stretched out the most . i can say this because in the data table it says b t t . p b the students could have done better is measure the plastic while it s hanging off the table . lastly they could have done is arrange the time minutes is too long they should ve done minutes .
4509	2	a according to the data t was more successful because for plastic type a and b the amount stretched was more than it was in t . in t the plastic was more stretched . p b . the students could have used different clamps to see if it affected the stretch . p . they could have extended the time .
4510	2	a in trial two only plastic type a b stretched more than trials plastic type c d either stayed the save of stretch . p b do more trials and test out different lengths of plastic
4511	2	based on the students data plastic type b is the stretchiest because during both trials it stretched mm which is more than the other plastics . p the students would have improved the validity and experimental design by adding trials and making clear how much weight was hung from each of piece of plastic .
4512	2	a it can be concluded that plastic b had the most stretchability . i say this because the amount it stretched was much more than the other plastics . p b this experiment could be improved in a couple ways first for the second trial the student should be sure to use another sample of that plastic . another way this could be improved would be to a clamp for the top of the plastic instead of tape .
4513	2	from my results i can conclude that the plastic that was the most stretchable was type b . plastic type b had the greatest length in stretchability compared to the rest . type d was very stretchable as well measuring mm in each trial but plastic b measured mm and mm . one thing i would improve to this experiment is make sure all the plastics in the beginning are the same length . second specify how many weights are added to the clone .
4514	2	conclusion of this experiment would be that plastic type b was the polymer that stretched the most . trial one it stretched mm and trial two it stretched mm . p one way they could improve the experiment is to record and keep the amount of weights added to the clamp for more valid results . they could also perform more than just two trials for a more valid results .
4515	2	a my conclusion based on the student at is that from a c the thread goes up and on d they both are the same . p b they could of counted how many weights they put the time that they practice the trials to show difference .
4516	2	based on the data provided plastics a and c stretch almost half the amount that plastics b and d did . in conclusion plastics a and c are stronger and better for the use of grocery bags or food protection while plastics b and d are for when materials need to stretch . the validity of the experimental design is questionable . the students didn t give an exact weight for amount of weights to stretch on which doesn t give accurate data . the student should ve specified what types of plastic .
4517	2	the students could do the experiment mute times and keep the temp future the same and the time and th ph . p make t different .
4518	2	a . you can conclude from this data that plastic type b is the stretchiest . plastic a stretched mm and mm . plastic b stretched mm and mm . plastic c stretched mm and mm plastic d stretched mm and mm . p a way to improve this experiment would to have a control to hang off the table for minutes . also you want to make sure the weight being added to the plastic is a constant weight .
4519	2	. a based on the data plastic type a is the most stretchable . b the student could have put the first measurement in the data table also a could have specified how much weight was used .
4520	2	a conclusion that i can draw on the data is that plastic type b stretched the most has the most stretchability and type a has the least . ways that the student could have improved their experiment is cutting all the types of plastic the same length so they could start off the same . another thing they could have improved is listing their indecent dependent variables . this is any conclusion about their lab .
4521	2	a based on the students results i d have to say plastic type b had the overall best stretchability values while plastic type a seems not to qualify so much in this area . p b the student could have improved this experiment by specifying the weight of each weight and how many weights to add to the clamp . the results are valid to extent . to make them more conclusive and higher their validity the student could have let the weights hang for different amounts of time for each trial .
4522	2	in the polymer lab plastic b is the strongest . plastic type b stretched a total of mm were plastic a only stretched mm in total . two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to have more trials . also make the plastics beginning measurement the same size .
4523	2	based on the students data plastic type a the amount stretched mm increase from mm . plastic type b amount stretched increase from mm . plastic type c amount stretched stayed the same . p the student could have improved the experiment by doing trials and doing a control variable .
4524	2	my conclusion for this experiment is that the polymer used for plastic type a made the plastic stretch more than others . this student could ve labeled everything like the name of the plastic polymers . another thing was he didn t state the problem or question .
4525	2	i conclude that both trial and trial s results were almost identical . for plastic type a and b trial stretched farthest . in plastic type c trial stretched further . finally in plastic type d both trial and stretched mm . p they should have measured very plastic type not just . step should be record your data and make a graph .
4526	2	plastic type b stretches the most while type a stretches the least . this experiment does not need improvement . it is fine the way it is . all experiments are beautiful in their own way .
4527	2	two ways the students could have done better on their experimental design is one thing they should of instead of taking an example of one plastic take a sample from all four plastics . also the weight of clamped bass and had then put longer then give minutes .
4528	2	based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type b was the weakest because it stretched the most and became deformed weight . also i can conclude that plastic type a was the strongest because it really stretch and it held its form . ways the student could have improved this experiment is by telling us what type of plastic it is also making sure all plastic pieces are cut the same this way one doesn t have an advantage .
4529	2	plastic type b has the most stretchability . one way the students could have improved their experiment is by making sure each type of plastic has the same length . another way their experiment could have been improved is if the students did more trials .
4530	2	the dates not accurate because they did not said what the length it is there no control and there missing a third trial . p b they should pick a length for the plastic and have a control .
4531	2	a plastic type b was very stretchy because it stretched mm when weights were added to it . on the other hand plastic type a was the least stretchy because it only stretched mm . b one way to improve the the experiment is to specify how much weight is being placed on the plastic . right now that amount is unclear and may pose a validity issue . another way to improve the experiment is to specify how long each plastic type is . they should all be the same length because if one is longer there will be more of it hanging off the table which would make it a bit more stretchy and throw off validity .
4532	2	a according to the student s data the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type b . in the first trial it stretched mm . in the second trial it stretched mm . p b the student could ve improved the experimental design by adding more trials . they also could ve been specific on how many pounds to add on the plastic .
4533	2	plastic type a was the least stretchy polymer and plastic type b was the most stretchy . the students could have improved the validity of the results by doing three trials instead of two and finding the average of all three . also they should have specified the amount of weights and that the same amount should be used for each plastic type because the results would not be valid if weight was another independent variable
4534	2	my conclusion based on the student data the amount of the plastic type the first ways the student should have improved repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining of all plastic the second one perform a second trial exactly like the first one .
4535	2	b two way the students could have improve this experiment is by adding more groups and reciting the experiment trial p a plastic type a is better than the others because during the trials didn t stretch much as other one so that means that is better .
4536	2	a the trials and differed in the amount stretched by increasing and decreasing at times . p b they should have done trials not and say repeat steps not repeat exactly to do trial number .
4537	2	a plastic b has the best tensile stretch in compared to plastics a c and d . p b . the students could do more trials and make sure the plastics are all the same type .
4538	2	the data shows that plastic type b is the most durable plastic out of all of them . some ways he could have improved were to have a rd trials . also instead of using only times of plastic he could have gotten or more times .
4539	2	. based on the student s data plastic type d stretched the most .
4540	2	from the student s data you can conclude that plastic type b is the stretchiest and plastic type a is the least stretchy . two ways the student could have improved the experiment are to increase the amount of trials and to increase the number of plastic bags tested .
4541	2	based on the trial it showed that plastic type d stretched more then any of the other plastics . p two ways they could have improved there lab would be measuring how far off of the table each piece should be measuring it so its the same and to add the some amount of weight to each plastic .
4542	2	a all of the plastic stretched after minutes of weights were hanging from it . the largest plastic stretched was plastic b it stretched mm mm . p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results are say the amount of weight used for the stretching and have another trial .
4543	2	from this data i can conclude that plastic d stretched the most therefore it held the most weight . when weight was added the plasticity in the plastic increased and began to stretch . p one way this student could have improved the validity of their results is by adding another trial to increase reliability . another way this student could have improved validity is by adding different types of plastic increasing the types of variables .
4544	2	based on the students data plastic type b stretched the most plastic d second most plastic c third most and plastic type a stretched the least . i think the students could have improved their validity by hanging all the plastics next to each other and putting the same amount of weight on all of them at the same time and record how far each stretches before they snap .
4545	2	based on the data on which plastic has the most stretchability i can conclude that most of the plastics either got a little bit longer or stayed the same in trial after minutes . also the c type plastic might have gotten smaller because it was a stronger plastic and didn t want to stretch . two ways the experiment could ve been improved was by instead of using tape they should ve used something stronger like mo s clamps . also another way they could ve changed the balance of the results would be to let the plastics hang longer than min so they have more time to stretch .
4546	2	based on the results plastic b had the most stretchability not of all of the plastic samples in trial being stretched to mm and in trial being stretched to mm . the student heave specified exactly how many weights would be added to the clamp . the student also should have added a control to compare to the other plastics for example a plastic sample that could not stretch .
4547	2	a the experiment is being test on how the polymer plastics be affected on stretchability . the independent variable is the plastic type . the dependent variable is the amount of stretched . it s constant by repeating the same trial more than once . the data shows trial is best of amount stretched . the control is trial . p b two ways the students have improved on the experiment is to repeat more and same timing .
4548	2	a plastic type d is the least stretchable and plastic type a is the most stretchable . p b the students should have explained how the weights should be added it is unclear how or how much weight should be added . they should also make all the plastic pieces the same length making the data easier to read .
4549	2	from the data you can conclude polymer b is capable of being stretched the most and polymer a is the least . improvements that could be made to this experiment are first keep the amount or weights you add to clamp constant and also performing more trials and changing your data would make the data more clear and accurate .
4550	2	plastic type d consistently can stretch the most according to these two trials . therefore plastic type d has the greatest stretchability . p the student could have recorded of the plastic tapped or not how mush weight they were adding to the clamp .
4551	2	i think that plastic type a is the strongest plastic because it stretched the least in both trial one and two . this plastic only stretched an average of mm . i conclude that the plastic type a must have been cross linked . because it was the strongest out of all four of the plastic . the experiment could have been improved if they put one more trial for each plastic type and if they had a control variable .
4552	2	the amount stretched with the plastic type act time in increase more and more . if this could continue to happen the plastic will rip . p the student should it coded more details and information to it so it would made a clear .
4553	2	based on the students data plastic type a is the strongest because it stretched the least . in trial it stretched mm and in trial it stretched mm . plastic type d stretched the most it stretched mm each trial . the students should start out with all the plastic the same length and they should conduct more trials of for valid and accurate results .
4554	2	based on the student s data we can conclude that plastic type b was able to stretch the most mm . while type a was the least . overall the data was accurate both trials got around the same results . although a third trial would have increased the validity . also the procedure is vague they should have included the difference types of plastic . the data table should also include the starting and ending lengths of the plastic samples .
4555	2	from the student s data i can conclude that plastic b stretched the most and plastic a stretched the least . p one way the students could have improved their experimental design was establish a control and do more trial .
4556	2	the student make a data table to test the four different polymer plastics or stretchability . he di a data table he put the plastic type a b c d and the amount stretched mm t . and t . he use this table to find his answer . i think he could make a better explanation about the test he was supposed to show and explain .
4557	2	a . the polymer with the most amount of stretchability is plastic type b . p b . the group could have made sure each plastic was the exact same length . the also could have specified exactly how much weight to add before letting the plastic hang for five minutes .
4558	2	types of plastic were tested a b c and d . type a was mm then it was stretched to . type b was than stretched to mm . type c was than stretched back to mm . type d was mm and it stayed the same . next time he could have done another trial to verify the results again . then extend the amount of time and weight compare the rd trial to the st nd trial and see the outcomes .
4559	2	based on the students data the plastic type b stretched the most out of all of them . p the student could have used new plastics for the second trial and could have done more trials to verify the results .
4560	2	based on the students data the amount stretched between test and test their isn t much of a difference because they are either off by one or two millimeters or it didn t change at all . two ways the student could have improved is ran more tests and test more types of plastics .
4561	2	the conclusion on base or the student s data is that b have the most amount stretched mm d have mm ll y mm a about stretched mm . p by telling us what type or plastic and by explaining better how to do it .
4562	2	a the type b plastic was the most stretchable because the first test it stretched mm and the second it stretched mm . this was more than any other plastics . p b the students could have added one more test to the experiment to get more accurate data . also the should have had the same amount of weight on the plastics for more accurate data .
4563	2	a based on the student s data plastic type b has the most stretchability out of these polymer plastics and type a has the least . b to improve this experiment the student could ve specified how much weight was added to each clamp and he could ve added a control group so he had something to compare the results against .
4564	2	plastic type d stretched the most out of all of the plastics because it stretched mm in both t and t . plastics a b c stretched an average of mm . mm and . mm respectively . p one way the experimental design could be improved is by specifying how much weight is to be clamped on the plastic in step to increase validity . also the lengths of the plastics should be kept constant throughout all the trials .
4565	2	a conclusion that can be made from this experiment is plastic type b stretched the most because it stretched the largest amounts in both trials with mm and then mm . this plastic probably is not the strongest because it stretched a lot . plastic type a only stretched mm in the first trial and mm in the second trial . the student could have tested the plastics with weights at various amounts of time not just minutes . also the student could have tested each plastic more than once to increase the validity of the results .
4566	2	a based on the students data one could conclude that polymer plastics b and d stretched more than a and c being stretched the most and a being stretched the least amount . p b the students could improve this experiment by measuring the plastics normally as they did but then was completely stretching the material by weights or by hand and measuring if a completely stretched rather than after measuring it . also because some results varied then they could have performed another time to ensure accuracy and then find the average .
4567	2	according to the student s data type b stretch the most . in both trials this plastic proved the most stretchable . however his data is partially invalid because a if different length plastics are used a larger length will always be measured more than a shorter length plastic . also the amount of weights need to be constant because the amount of weight used can greatly alter how stretched the plastic .
4568	2	a in conclusion plastic type a stretched the most and plastic type d didn t stretch at all . p b two ways the students could have improved is by doing more trials and by saying the amount of weight that used on the plastics .
4569	2	a plastic type b was the most stretched in t . p b these could have on the experiment over to double check their work and made sure type c was correct .
4570	2	one conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic b is the strongest . two ways that the student could improve the experiment design and or the validity is to specify how much weight to add on the clamp and to make sure all of the samples are the same size .
4571	2	a . we conclude that plastic type b had stretched the further in both trial and trial . as you see in the data table plastic b stretched mm in trial and mm in trial . p b . two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is by increasing the amount of trials and have a specific number of weights instead of just adding a random amount .
4572	2	a . according to the table between plastics a b and c the amount stretched increased by increased by one and decreased by but d stayed the same . p b . two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are more types of plastic bags and repeat the procedure .
4573	2	based on the students data polymer plastic type b is stretches the most . plastic type b had the longest amount stretched . one way the student could have improved his experiment is to have added the same amount of weights to each clamp . another way to improve the experiment is to make sure all the plastics are the same length in the beginning of the experiment .
4574	2	after reading the students data on the polymer investigation i can conclude that plastic a is the strongest polymer because it only stretched mm in t and mm in t and plastic b is the most flexible because it stretched mm in t and mm in t . two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by adding a control to compare the results to and specify how much weight to hang on the polymers .
4575	2	a plastic b stretched the most followed by plastics d c and a stretching the least . p b measure the distance the plastic is leaped from the edge of the table and keep consistent for all the plastics . specify the amount of weight added to the clamp and keep consistent for all the plastics .
4576	2	based on the data polymer b had the largest stretchability . p b the student could have done one more trial to ensure accurate results . make sure the tape is the same place for each sample so that it gives the same support and more accurate answers .
4577	2	they should make different trials . p they should use clamps it masses thing up .
4578	2	based on the data it is evident that overall plastic b was the most stretchable and plastic a was the least stretchable . polymer a possibly has a cross linked structure since it is more rigid and strong while polymer b is probably liner or branched in structure . one way the student could have improved the validity of the results could be to cut the plastics to equal size . this way length would be a constant . also the experiment s procedure does not specify the mass of the weights if the mass was kept constant for all of the tests the results would be much more valid .
4579	2	based on this student s data the plastic type b stretches the farthest while plastic type a stretches the least amount . to improve the students results it would be important to add a control to the experiment . another way to improve would be to add additional trials to the experiment to increase the validity of the results .
4580	2	based on the student s data i concluded that plastic type b had the highest stretchability because it stretched mm in t and mm in t which was more than all of the other plastic types . two ways the student could have improved the experiment validity of results could be to conduct a rd trial to get more accurate results and specify what polymer plastics were used so that someone could accurate the experiment .
4581	2	a based on the data table if you add weight to plastic types while it is hanging some of the thin plastic type will get longer . during the times in the experiment it does not longer . p b in step four the students should have told you how many weights to add to the types of plastic . the student should have measured the plastics before they stretched them . this would help with the validity of the results because you will be able to compare its regular length to the stretched length to help your conclusion .
4582	2	a conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type b was the strongest plastic . p they can improve this experiment by having more trials . also they can add more weight for another three trials to be sure that their results were accurate .
4583	2	the student should of used a foam cup instead of a plastic one and also used beaker weights and a clamp that was made for experiments like these . it would of made is data come out with a lot of better results .
4584	2	b is the most stretchable plastic out of all four . one way to improve it is saying how much weight they used on each one and if the changed it . the second way would be to test four or five different ones .
4585	2	based on the experiment i draw the conclusion that plastic type a is the strongest . this is because plastic type a stretched the least of all the plastics in trial and . to improve this experiment the students could do more trials this would make their finding more valid . also the student s don t provide the initial length of each piece of plastic which makes conclusions like mine possible incorrect .
4586	2	in conclusion plastic type b is the most that was stretched out the all the others . something the student could have done better is tell us how much weight he put them to make it stretch out .
4587	2	based on the students experiment the conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic b is able to stretch the most millimeters in both trials and . one way the students could have improved the experimental design of their experiment is by saying what size weight they had used for each plastic . the last way is by saying what type of plastic they used .
4588	2	plastic d was the most stretched . p the student could it should at the original measurement was of the plastic before stretched
4589	2	a in conclusion the type of plastic that stretched the largest is b . the amount b has stretched was t and t . p b two ways they could of improved their experiment was one add weights and repeat the trial a few more times .
4590	2	base on the data all four plastic for t is different from t . each trial follow the same procedure . it should be right on the same amount that mean the trial is wrong . p b student can read and go through everything to proved on their project . student should write down everything that they done each trial .
4591	2	plastic d stretched the same amount every time . plastics a and b increased when they stretched . plastic c decreased when it stretched . p the students could have done an experimental for each polymer .
4592	2	a conclusion based on the students data is that plastic b has the highest stretchability while plastic a has the least stretchability . two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by specifying the weights of weights and use the same amount for each trial . another change would be to conduct at least one more trial these improvements would greatly improve validity of the results .
4593	2	a . plastic type b is the most stretchable of all the plastics while type a is the least stretchable . p b . the first way would have been for the students to have defined the weight of the weights . also the before and after lengths of the weights should have been defined .
4594	2	my conclusion on the students data is that plastic c always had the most stretchability . ways the students could ve improved the experiment was to leave it hanging longer and use a little more weights .
4595	2	based on the data given by the students all of the plastic wraps stretched approximately the same amount for both trials and . one way the students could have improved the validity of their results is by adding a section to the table that showed what the starting length of the plastic wrap were . another way is that in the experimental design the amount of weights added could have been more specific .
4596	2	plastic types a and c didn t hold very well . however plastic b and d held more . i say that plastic b as the better solution and outcome to use because pt adds more and pt has a good stretch .
4597	2	a plastic type b has the most stretch . p b the student could add more trials and the student could make sure to use the same size samples for each trial .
4598	2	. a in conclusion it shows that plastic b can hold more weights than the others . trial only stretched mm and trial stretched mm . p b two ways the student can improve is the number of weights applied to the plastic bag . also the amount of time it took for the bag to rip added more time .
4599	2	a . based on the students results a conclusion that can be drawn is plastic type b has the highest stretchability . p p b one way the student could have improved the experiment was state mass of the weights . p p c another way the students could have improved the experiment was to ensure the same mass of the weights were used for each type of plastic type .
4600	2	a my conclusion is that t plastic type a will be b c and d . p b a way the students could ve improved is by having a particular time limit for all of the trials . another way to improve is by having a certain amount of weights so the data can be more accurate .
4601	2	the conclusion i can make of the student s data is plastic type b has highest stretchability and plastic type a has the lowest stretchability . this experimental design could have been improved by letting us know how many weights he used for each plastic types . he or she also could have told us how long was the length of each type of plastic was used .
4602	2	the gradually increase with caution plastics a and b and c and d either remain the same is get changes . one way to improve the experiment would be to explain what type of plastics they re using . another could be to repeat the trials more than twice .
4603	2	after reading the students data i have come to a conclusion that plastic type b stretched the most on both trials because it has and which is higher than the other plastic types they investigated .
4604	2	in conclusion if type a b c and d are stretched then type b plastic will stretch the most since it stretched about mm . then the type a plastic will stretch the least since it stretched about mm one way the student could improve design is do one trial without weights to assure the plastic will not stretch from gravity s force or other elements . next the student should have made each plastic the same length because with different length a second length is present . finally in the procedure the students should use the same amount of weights for each trial and plastic .
4605	2	plastic b is the polymer plastic that had the biggest amount of stretch . one way that could improve this experiment is when you and the weight use a certain amount a lot than next trial and more weight . another thing that can improve the result of the experiment is to you do a third trial .
4606	2	one way the student could have improved the experiment is instead of performing a second trial exactly like the first one they could have switched up a little to make it more interesting . another way the student could have improved the experiment is used other objects other than only weights .
4607	2	the student could have put more weights on the clamp to let the plastic be more stretchable and it would get more big and it could hole more thing .
4608	2	type was lower on numbers in mm compared to type but type was more consistent . also plastic b was stretchiest . p the student could or improved by stepping it out to visualize it better . also you can never for get labels and variables .
4609	2	a out of all the plastics b has stretched the most and looks as if it want go any further . the least stretchable is a plastic . p b two ways they could of improved the experiment is by doing a t and or try different amounts of weight and ice if done more each time makes a difference .
4610	2	plastic b is the most stretchability plastic a is the least . the students should have changed the amount of weight put on each plastic . the plastics could have stretched more depending on how much weight they can use . the students should also have done a control and let the plastic half with that the lamp .
4611	2	a conclusion i drew about the students data is that plastic a stretched more in trial than trial . also that in trial plastic b stretched mm than trial . in trial for plastic it didn t stretch as much as trial at trial and plastic d stretched the same . the student could have improve their experiment is by adding a clamp at the top and bottom of the plastic sample . another way the students experiment could have been improved is trying a third trial .
4612	2	a the conclusion of the students results is that plastic type b was able to stretch the farthest without increasing . p b ways the students could have improved their experiment are to say what wait to measure the plastics in in the procedure . what the procedure you are adding weigh .
4613	2	plastic type d stayed the same throughout the trail . p the student could have improved the experiment by being more septic with the weights ie are they g or g and explain how they are going to measure the plastic samples .
4614	2	based on the student s data plastic type b is the most stretchable followed by plastic type d then c and finally a . the student could have made the procedure better if they had specified the original length of the plastic and by adding one more trial it could have further solidified their results .
4615	2	a in both trial one and two had stretched the less b had starched more than any other in both trials . p the student could have improved improved the experimental design he or she could have added the length they started with . also they could have made th length start the same . it would have come out better .
4616	2	in conclusion plastic type d will be stretched the most in the data . i have found because in both trials it has mm stretched . p two way the student could have improved their procedure is by having the same type of length for each plastic type in the beginning and second they should reform the procedure at the same time as the other plastics .
4617	2	a based on the students results i can conclude that the b plastic is the stretchiest because it stretched the most when its trials trials lengths were averaged . p b one way they could have improved their design was to make sure the same weight was on each plastic sample and to do three trials for each plastic rather than two to make their results more valid .
4618	2	after understanding the table i came to conclude that polymer plastic a has the highest stretchability level . one way this lab can be improved is by taking into consideration the weight of the clamp that stays constant wen adding it to the calculations of the weight on the polymer plastic . also more trials could or been done .
4619	2	in conclusion type a is the strongest plastic and plastic type b is the weakest . type c and d are in the middle but d is master and dose to b . p one way of improving this experiment i could be testify more plastics . also the student would of change the same from to or any other time .
4620	2	based on the data my conclusion will be that the students did something wrong with plastic type c and d . two ways this experiment could be improved is adding another trial and stating the amount of weight they used on the plastics .
4621	2	the data is inconclusive because there is no controlled test in the experiment . the student could have improved by including a list materials . he she should also have been more specific such as say be what units to measure in and how many weights to use and how big small they are . he she should have also had a control and labeled which types of plastics used .
4622	2	a . the hypothesis in this experiment can not be supported because there was not one stated the plastic type that stretched the most was type b which stretched an average of mm the plastic that was most resistance to stretch was type a which stretched an average of mm . p the students could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results by having more trials and by telling you how heavy the weights are supposed to be .
4623	2	everything went well and they eat everything the wanted . two ways that the students can improve on their experiment is they maybe do more experiments instead of doing . the next thing that they can improve in is not taping the edge and seeing what happens when they don t so that is what they can improve on .
4624	2	a conclusion based on the students data is t and t a b c and d whigs a close . there in the same area . two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is if they were to let it hang then five minutes and if you were to attach something other then a clamp .
4625	2	a . the conclusion is . p b . the students could have improve their experiment by adding a weight to each trials they do . they can also compare both plastics to see which one is stranger or stretch the longest .
4626	2	plastic type d is the most stretchable . the student could have shown the amount of height put on the plastics . also they could have added more trials to make their results more precise .
4627	2	a based on the student s data of the stretchability of polymers plastic d stretched the farthest . also the other plastics stretched mm more during the second trial but plastic d remained at mm . p b the student could have improved in their experimental design and validity . for example in the procedure the student should have state more clearly whether he or she used the exact piece of plastics for each trial . also the student could have included what each plastic was .
4628	2	the conclusion for the student s data is that slightly two went up one went down and one stood the same . first way students could improve is by adding different kind of weight . another way is by changing the length of the plastic .
4629	2	a in this conclusion plastic type d stretched the least t and t times mm . then plastic type b which stretched about to for t and t . p b they should have mentioned the safety procedure what should be worn when doing this lab . they should have also mentioned how many minutes each should have .
4630	2	the student could of done a graph to improve the experiment design . the student could of also done an experiment or maybe could of drawn the process .
4631	2	a i can conclude from this data that plastic a is harder to stretch and that plastic b is easiest to stretch . p b two ways the student could improved the validity of the results are to start with the same lengths of each plastic and to add equal amounts of weight to each plastic .
4632	2	a based on the students data plastics . type d had most stretchability plastic . type a had the lowest stretchability . b one way to improve the experiment could be to have more that . another way could be to manually stretch plastic rather than using weights .
4633	2	a based on the data the amount stretched was not much of a difference . p b two ways the experiment could have been made improved is they could have made the trial longer and added a rd trial . also they could have used a control .
4634	2	the conclusion that can be drawn from the data of the experiment is that plastic b was the stretchiest plastic of the four plastics . one way that the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing about three of four trials instead of just two . this is because by doing more trials you can see if you might have made an error compare in the experiment if the data you collect doesn t seem reliable . the second way the students could have improved their experimental design is by identifying which polymer plastics are which . this is important because people need to know the name of the polymer plastic to be able to understand the experiment .
4635	2	my conclusion from the data is that man time the plastic was stretched the second time they stretched longer because after the first time it was very loose and worn out . two ways they could have improved was by trying third time but with different objects to stretch the plastics and by trying different plastics for each trial .
4636	2	based on the data shown plastic type b is the polymer plastic with the most stretchability . one way the student could have improved the design of the experiment is by then taking each polymer and seeing how much weight could be used to stretch it how far . one more way to improve the flexibility of the experiment is by making sure that the plastic is taped in the same flow . every time so the amount hanging of the table is constant .
4637	2	a my conclusion based on these students data would be that plastic type b stretched the most on both trials . p b one way they can improve their experiment is by again including a control another way is to add more time instead of letting the plastic hang there for minutes try like mrs .
4638	2	i think that plastic b is the most stretchy because on trial it is the longest and trial . they could ve said how much weight they put on and they could ve put how much plastic they used .
4639	2	could at made a better chart or make a better way to solve it .
4640	2	in conclusion it seems that type a b had stretched about mm . type c d had other plans . for type c the tape shorten about mm and type d didn t stretch at all . p two ways . name the type of tape they are using . . add the measurements in the table .
4641	2	i can conclude from the students experiment that plastic type a is a lot stronger then any of the other plastic because on the second trial it stretched a whole mm more than it did in the first trial . one way the could have improved their experiment is to do another trial . also they could have added the same amount of weights to each type of plastic to improve validity .
4642	2	a i concluded that the plastic type b was strongest type d was second third was c and th was plastic type a . p he should have recorded the length of the plastics before the weight was added . he should have use all the same weights to screen the plastic .
4643	2	in this experiment it is shown that plastic bag b has a higher stretchability then any other bag because in trial it received mm and in trial it received mm these amounts of plastic stretched were higher then any other bag . bag d was the closest in range to bag b receiving mm .
4644	2	a student performed an experiment to see how the amount of weight affects the type of bag . the bag that worked the best in both of the trials was bag b it stretched to mm and mm . the bag that did the worst was bag a . stretching only mm and mm . the student could have improved their experimental design by saying what types of plastics they were using . they also could have made their results more valid if they had a control .
4645	2	a conclusion of those results is that type d plastic appears to be the strongest because it stretched the least and type a is the weakest because it stretched the most . p two ways they could have improved the experimental design is by being more specific with how much weight they should add in step . also the should have re tested trial of plastic type c because their results show that it shrank instead of stretched which is impossible in this experiment .
4646	2	i concluded that plastic type b stretched the most in trial and trial . they could have improved the design or validity by using weight that all weigh the same and by making sure that all four types of plastics were taped at the edge of the table in the same spot .
4647	2	a . plastic a is the best plastic to use because it is stronger than the rest of the plastics since it stretched the least . p b . . could have done trials instead of just . . said how much weight was used on each plastic .
4648	2	a conclusion that can be drawn based on the groups data is that their results are not very valid but plastic type b was the strongest . one way the student could have improved his her experiment design is to be more specific and clear with his her procedure . another way this student could have improved his her experiment is to conduct is trials instead of to get more valid results .
4649	2	the two ways the students have improved the experiment was to not repeat the trial for a second time .
4650	2	a plastic type b stretched the most . p b the student could have improved the experimental design by putting the number and weight of the weights and putt the original lengths of the plastics .
4651	2	the type a drastic appears to be the more resistant to stretching while type b seems the most prone to stretching . to better improve the lab they should use equal starting length for all the plastic types . they could also use a better adhesive than tape so that there is less of a chance the plastic might only down and give inaccurate results .
4652	2	nor .
4653	2	a conclusion for the investigation is that plastic type b is the most stretch . two ways the student could have improved the data would be either on trial is to have the plastic are same size way one plastic wouldn t have an unfair advantage over another . another way is to get new plastics for the new trial so you wouldn t mess up the data with the already plastic .
4654	2	polymer plastic type b was the most stretchable . polymer plastic type b stretched mm in its first trial and mm in its second . it stretched mm more than polymer plastic type d which stretched the second furthest at mm in both trials . p the student could have improved the validity of the results by saying how heavy the weights need to be . the student could have also improved the validity of the results also by saying what unit to measure in so no one accidentally measures in the wrong measurements .
4655	2	a conclusion that can be drawn from the student s data is that plastic type b stretched the furthest in both trials . the student could have improved their experimental design by including exactly how much weight to use instead of just saying weight . also they could have waited more than five minutes in order to get better results .
4656	2	he should control the amount of weight he is putting on the plastic . he should also use different types of plastic .
4657	2	plastic bag b was the strongest bag while a bag was the weakest . the student could of did more trials and tell us what he had to do keep the excrement going .
4658	2	a . based on the data received from the students table i can conclude that plastic type b was the one that stretched the most . it stretched mm and . also plastic type a was the best and barely stretched . it came in at only mm and mm . p b . to improve the experimental design they could have explain how to secure the clamp and weights to the plastic material and they could have told us how large the piece of plastic must be to do this experiment .
4659	2	a conclusion based on the student s data would be if we tested four different plastics to see which one had the most stretchability then plastic b would stretch the most . p two ways the students could have improved their experiment are one they could have repeated it a third time to make sure everything was correct and their were no anomalies . another way they could have improved the experiment is they could have made sure they had an equal amount of weight on each plastic sample .
4660	2	based on this students data on stretchability of plastics i can conclude that plastic type b stretched the most or had the most stretchability after being weighed down for minutes . two ways this student could have improved the experiment and its results could be first using a set number of weights to add to the clamp not just adding as much as possible . secondly the student should have made a control of how long each piece of plastic was in mm before its stretchability was tested .
4661	2	a a conclusion can be drawn that plastic type b was the stretchiest based on the data and that it would be the most durable . p b two ways they could improve the experiment would be to control the amount of weight added and to control the length and width of the plastics . wider and longer plastics would most likely be stretchier . so this adds another variable to the experiment . if more weight is added to one substance than another then the plastics would less easier .
4662	2	based on the students data table can concluded that plastic type b stretched out the longest than any of the the plastics . two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by first identified what she used as weights to hold down the plastic and the second way is to possibly do a third trial of doing this experiment because the amount of plastic stretched was so close in the first two trials .
4663	2	the second trial the length of cup increased compared to first trial . p the student could ve done more trial just to have better data .
4664	2	the conclusion of these student would be that plastic b had the greatest stretchability out of all the plastics with mm in trial and in trial . one way the students could have improved the validity of the results would be to include the actual total weight of the weights and that also that constant throughout the experiment . the other way to improve result would be to also include the starting weight or length of the plastic and keep that constant for all of the other plastics .
4665	2	a . based on the data gathered the best polymer in plastic a stretch ability would have to be plastic b because it stretched the most . p b . he could have improved it s validity by recording the measure of its length before he began the experiment .
4666	2	i think plastic type b will stretch the most and two ways the student can improve this is they could do more trial and let them hang longer .
4667	2	plastic type b stretched the farthest because in trial it stretched mm and trial stretched mm . the student could ve put in the table mm per minute so it would be more accurate or he she could ve made a graph to show per minute how each plastic stretched .
4668	2	it appears that plastic type b stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least to improve their experiment they should have done a third trial and instead of attaching a clamp to just one corner there should be another clamp in the other corner to make it even .
4669	2	based on the data table i can conclude that plastic a is the most stretchable . one way the student could have improved the experimental design is to measure carefully and to conduct more trials .
4670	2	in the experiment done by the student it appears that plastic type b was the stretchiest on average mm . ways the student would be making all the initial plastic samples the same length before hand and specifying how much weight to put on the clamp .
4671	2	a in conclusion the experiment worked effectively because for plastic type a and b the plastic stretched from mm in trial to mm in trial and plastic b stretched from mm to mm . p b this experiment can be improved by including constant or a control such as the initial length of each plastic . the validity of this experiment can also be improved by including more trials .
4672	2	a the student s data was very relative it showed the types of plastic used and how much it had stretched afterward . their data for trial one was close to their data for trial two . for example in t for plastic a it stretched mm in t for plastic a it stretched mm therefore their data was accurate . p b two ways the students could have improved the experimental design validity are to add a third trial and to be more specific about adding weights . tell us how many and how much they weigh .
4673	2	after testing different plastic samples two times ti find which one stretched the most we found that plastic b stretched the furthest mm . one way the students could improve their design and or valid cities could be by naming the types of plastics they used . another could be by trying the experiment with different sized weights to see if that causes the results to vary .
4674	2	based on the data plastic b stretched the most mm . that proves that the polymers are ductile . the plastic that stretched the least was plastic a but plastic c was only mm longer than plastic a . plastic d was in between plastic c and b with mm stretched . there could ve been error with how the student clamped or pulled the plastic . one way the student could ve improved the validity of their results would be doing at least trials . another way the student could ve improved experimental design would be by in the procedure telling what plastic to use first .
4675	2	a plastic type b is the most durable because it stretched mm the first time mm the second time . the average is . mm which the greatest average coming all of the plastic types . p the student could have done more trials to improve the validity of the experiment . the student could also make the plastics are all of the same length to improve the validity also .
4676	2	in the student data all of the plastic type
4677	2	a i can conclude that plastics b d are the most stretchable because of the length of their plastic in the end . p b . they should have made the procedure more clear . for example kilo on the procedure needed to be more specific on whether or not the weights should stay removed . also they should have kept all plastics in the experiment the entirely of the time because it was misleading inaccurate and logical to keep one out . add more trial would suffice .
4678	2	a plastics d and b are weaker than plastics a and c . a is the strongest plastic and b is the weakest . p b the plan does not mention how the plastics should be measured . also the plan does not say to use different types of plastics .
4679	2	a . you can conclude that plastic b is the most stretchable . p b . they could have improved their experiment if they said haw much weight they used and stated the initial length of each plastic .
4680	2	a based on the students data i can tell that plastic type d is the most consistent . it stayed at mm s each trial . c is the weakest because in the first trial it held mm and in the second it only held mm . p b two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to do it for a third time and to say the weight of each weight .
4681	2	polymer investigation draw a conclusion based on student data .
4682	2	the conclusion of this experiment would be that test two mostly stretched further likely because the plastic is already stretched from test one . p they could have improved the experiment by doing both trials with the same time to see the difference between the two . also they could have used different plastics for both trials so it wasnt previously stretched from trial .
4683	2	a the conclusion you can draw is that plastic type b has the best stretchability out of the plastics . p b the student should have said how long the plastic was when they first ripped it off . the student could have used all different lengths therefore making this not valid . also the student could have done more than trials to make the experiment more valid .
4684	2	seeing from the students data table a conclusion i can draw is that plastic type d is the strongest material and most stretched . p they could have improved by using an additional step for recording their data . also they could have used the same length plastic to begin .
4685	2	based on this data plastic b stretched the most since for both trials it stretch further trials any other plastic . plastic a is the least stretchability according to the experiment because for both trials it stretched the least . a way to improve the experimental design would be to specify the amount of weights so each plastic can receive the same amount of weight . another way to improve the experiment would be to have each plastic start at the same length so then can better be compared .
4686	2	a a conclusion of the data would be that sample b is the one that stretches the most . also based on the experiment plastic type a did the least amount of stretching and plastic type c didn t stretch as much rather sample d did pretty well but it stretched the same amount both trials . p b the experiment could have been better if it was repeated again . it would have been better also if the plastic length would have been more specific .
4687	2	plastic type b has the highest stretchability because it stretched the farthest at mm and mm for five minutes in trials and . plastic type a has the lowest stretchability only stretching mm in and mm in t . the student could have improved the experiment by making each plastic sample the same dimensions . also for each sample the clamps and type should be part in the same spot height amount should be specified .
4688	2	looking at the data i cant see that the amount stretched only changed by a little but for plastic type d it remained the same in both trials . they could have improved it by saying how heavy the weights should be . another way the kids could have improved it was to say what type of plastic did they use .
4689	2	the conclusion that can be identified from this investigation is that for the plastic type d in both trials the amount stretched were the same . two ways the student could ve improved his or her experiment is by expanding the trials to see if they turn out the same again . another way is to add the same type of weight for each one or change the place where the weights were put on the plastic bags .
4690	2	in conclusion based on the data the best polymer or plastic type would be plastic b because it stretched the farthest with the weights . one way the could improve was by reducing the time minutes and instead repeat the weights three which each plastic type or they could also done trial taped to the desk and trial holding by your hand .
4691	2	conclusion plastic b stretched the most and plastic a stretched the least . two ways to improve this experiment would be to include the original length of plastic and also the weight of the clamp and weights .
4692	2	plastic type b was the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic type a was the least stretchable . p the student should have this procedure used the same amount of weight on each plastic . also the student could have stated trials that were longer than minutes to see if time affected stretchability .
4693	2	the conclusion i can draw from this data is that plastic type a was the most stretchable . it stretched mm . plastic type b was at least stretchable . p the ancient could have improved the experiment by including the amount of weight that was clamped so the plastic . they could have added a control where were was no weight added to the clamp .
4694	2	a . plastic type b was longest in length for both t mm and t mm . plastic c had mm in t and mm in t and plastic d had mm for both trial and . so plastic b would be the at least plastic for stretchability . p two ways the experiment can be improved is if they included what type of plastic each was . and how much of a sample of plastic to measure they all should be same length and width .
4695	2	in plastic a the length went from mm to mm in plastic b the length went from mm to mm in plastic c the length went from mm to mm in plastic d the length stood the same . p he she should have added in the materials also explain it a little better .
4696	2	a . a stretched the most out of them all and d stayed the same . p b . more trials and they could of hang the plastic longer .
4697	2	their data was successful . the students could of have more plastic types . they also could of had amount stretched more data on it .
4698	2	the student could have not used same amount of weight as the st so he should have done that . also he could have clamped and put the weights in different positions .
4699	2	some of the plastic type have a little difference amount stretch . from t to t and some don t at all . one way the student could have improved the experiment is or determine the amount of weights use in experiment . also it would or been better is he perform a third trial .
4700	2	based on the data table type a was the lowest number and b was the highest . the student could ve improved the experiment by maybe having a rd trial done . they could ve also been more specific with the type of materials they used . ex . dark tape scotch tape e . t . c
4701	2	this experiment showed that adding weights to the plastic had very little effect on the plastic . these student could have told the amount of weight to add to the plastic in each trail . also the length of plastic they used . a brand of plastic could have helped because of it quilt tes .
4702	2	in this experiment plastic type b was able to support most weight and plastic type a was able to support the least amount of weight . this student could have improved this doing maybe a couple more examples so we could compel more . also they could have done the experiment to see how weight each plastic could support before falling .
4703	2	if four different polymer plastics are stretched to there maximum by weights than the matter at with the greatest amount of polymers will stretch the most because the length results will prove each ability to stretch . this concludes the data results to show that plastic type b was tested and proven to hold the most stretch . the students experimental design could have been improved by either informing the experimental exactly the constant length the plastic should be off the table or how materials .
4704	2	the students could have improved the experimental design by making a statement of how they improve and was it difficult as if they had to do it more than times .
4705	2	a . even though both times each plastic was tested the stretched about the same length . all of them either stayed the same of stretched an extra mm except for c which actually was smaller than the first trial . p b . two ways the could have improved are they could have counted how much weight it took to instead of stretching rip each plastic . a second improvement would be to trial each one more than twice perhaps three to four times .
4706	2	after testing the four different plastics for stretchability the students found that plastic a stretched mm longer plastic c actually got mm shorter and plastic d stayed the same length . i conclude that plastic a has the most stretchability and plastic c has the least . in the experimental design the student should have told us how much weight was being put on the plastic how far away term the edge we are to tape the plastic what measurements we are to use to measure the plastic .
4707	2	in conclusion plastic type b stretched the most it stretched to mm the first trial and mm the second . plastic type a stretched the least mm . but in my second trial plastic type a stretched mm . but plastic type d didn t fall behind by much the
4708	2	a . in this experiment only one object stretched out more after the second trial and that was plastic type a and plastic type c didn t stretched more after the trial . it stretched less . p b he could of explained how many plastic samples he had . he could of the measure men of plastic s before they were stretched to show the difference and how much it was stretched .
4709	2	a what i have concluded was that plastic b was the most stretchable in both its trials . p b two ways the students could have improved the experiment validity of the results was make each plastic the same measure in length to better compare it with one another and state what type of weight were used to stretch the plastic grams pounds and so on .
4710	2	plastic b b the most stretching at . mm average stretch followed by d which stretched mm then c at an average of . mm . the least stretching plastic is a having only stretched an average of mm . it can be concluded that in descending order the stretchiest b b followed by d then c then a . p the experiment could be improved by cutting the plastic pieces to identical sizes to ensure strongest validity and utilize weights of equal mass so that all plastics experience the same downward force .
4711	2	a polymer a is the least stretched because the length of it at the end of the test was the shortest . p i specify how much weight is to be added to the clamp . p . use a specific length of plastic at the beginning of each test .
4712	2	the student gathered very precise data that this the student s result for each plastic were similar in trial one and two . this means he or she did not make any glaring errors in their experiment . however two ways they could have improved their experimental design are to include the accepted stretching amount for each plastic which would require some research and to also include the measurement taken before the plastic were stretched in their data table .
4713	2	first the student should take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its length . second they should attach a clamp to the bottom edge of a plastic sample third they should tape the top of the plastic sample to a table so that its hanging freely down the side of the table . four add weights and clamp allow them to hang for five minutes . five remove the weight and clamp measure the length of a plastic types . p b two ways the student could of improved the experiment was one they should of explain there steps better second put the plastic types in order .
4714	2	what i have noticed is as the structure tested the plastic type the amount stretch would increase and decrease each time . two ways these students could have improved the experimental design would be doing another trial and adding more weights to the clamp .
4715	2	a . plastic type to would be best to use for stretchability . p b . they could ve improved this experiment by using the same length of plastics . also by getting the time of how long the plastics stretch for .
4716	2	a the student s data reveals that plastic type b was the plastic that stretched the most . p b the student could have improved the experimental design by including what material to use to measure the length of the plastic . the student could have also added to use the same weights for each plastic to make sure they are equally stretched .
4717	2	a conclusion the drawn is that plastic types a stretch the most and b stretch the second most while d stretched the same and c stretched . the students could have improved their experiment by having three trial instead of this ones telling what type of plastic was use instead of a b c and d .
4718	2	after the experiment plastic d was stretched out the most to mm in both trials . also in the experiment plastic a stretched the least in test to mm and in test to mm . p the student could have made his experiment better by having all the same plastics at the same length and say how much weights to put on the clamp . also to better his results he could do more trials and average the results to get accurate results .
4719	2	a based on the student s data it is visible that not every plastic was the same length . also the student probably did not make sure that they ended at exactly five minutes maybe five minutes and a few seconds . b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results is by making sure each plastic is the same length so all the data is accurate . also to make sure there is the same amount of plastic hanging off the table .
4720	2	in conclusion plastic b was the stretchiest because in both
4721	2	a the students can conclude that they found out that some plastics stretch and others don t move . b the students could of improved this by adding a lot more detail and probably added a hypothesis or they could of done a different method for stretching the plastic .
4722	2	a based on the students data we can conclude that plastic type d stretched the same a hunt in trial one and two . b the student could have improved their experiment by stating what amount of weight they were using and what type of plastics they were using also they should have performed three trials .
4723	2	a . my conclusion from this student s data is that plastic b has the most stretchability because it stretched mm in trial and mm in trial which was the longest that any of the plastics were able to stretch . p b . this student could have improved their experimental design by telling us how much each weight that was the ex stretching the polymers . should weigh to make the lab more accurate . also they should have included in the procedure that we were measuring in millimeters to avoid any confusion or inaccurate results .
4724	2	plastic type b is the most rigid and flexible of the plastics . p one way the student could of made the experiment better is by seeing which plastic stretched to its way first . another way the student could of improved is cut the plastic pieces to the same length .
4725	2	in conclusion plastic type a and b were stretched surprisingly type c stretch by a mm . type d just stayed the same . p allowed the weights to hang for longer . p tested more plastics or heavier weight .
4726	2	a you can conclude that the type of plastic used for trial one t was less stretchable than the plastic used in the second trial . p b the student could repeat their experiment . they could also have a constant in use the same type of plastic they used in each trial . they could also make sure to mention what instrument they used to measure the length of the plastic types .
4727	2	each type of plastic either stayed the same or increased for mm . this experiment can be improved adding more weight let the weights hang on it longer than minutes .
4728	2	based on the data polymer b stretched the farthest because it consistently stretched more than any other polymer . p one way experimental design could be improved is to continue steps and . a second way is to add a starting and ending length to the tables .
4729	2	they could have put more stronger type of plastic and put heavier or light weight on it .
4730	2	a conclusions plastic d is more effective the plastic a b c d . plastic b is also has a good stretchability as plastic as plastic plastic d best not as good . on the second trial . the stretchability of the plastic improved . on the second trial plastic d stayed the same plastic c depressed by one mm plastic a b increased by one mm . on both trials plastics a had a low stretchability . p b two ways the students could improve was by saying how much weight they were adding to the clamps and only using one type of weight not weights .
4731	2	plastic type b would have more stretchability than the others because the amount stretched is mm for the st trial but for the nd trial it which pares that this polymer plastic can stretch at a good amount . the student could ve made a more reasonable design that had less confusion would explain it better .
4732	2	the conclusion is some bags stretch more than others . one thing he could have improved on was being specific on how much weight he put on each bag . he could of also added weight for the second trail .
4733	2	i conclude that the plastic type that stretched the most was type b . i said type b stretched the most because for both trials type b had the larger numbers . in trial it was mm and in trial it was mm . the student could of improved the experiment by having the length of the plastic initially recorded so that you could compare them and also make sure for the nd trial that the starting length was the same length .
4734	2	in conclusion plastic type be was the strongest because in t it held weights . t it held weights . plastic a was the weakest plastic because in t it only held weights . t it held only so plastic b would be the best plastic . p the student could of done a third trial see if results get higher . hang the clamp for about minutes the probably could of got higher results .
4735	2	the plastics that were chosen for the experiment dont stretch very much and if they kept the weights on the plastic for more than minutes then the outcome may have come differently . another improvement would be to add a heavier weight and see how long it takes for the students to stretch and how long it stretches .
4736	2	in this experiment you are able to conclude that the plastic type a stretched the least which means that it is the most durable plastic out of the four . we should use plastic a because it is least likely to break . two ways the students could have improved their experiment is having a third trial to help them out . also to have a control group .
4737	2	what i got in conclusion is that plastic type b got stretched out more than the others to improve this experimental design was using more details like how much were the weights .
4738	2	from this experiment i conclude that plastic b is the stretchiest because it had a stretch of . plastic d had and the others were in tens two ways the students ca improve design is by testing a third time to make sure there was no mistakes and let the weight hang longer because it could be that one of the plastics takes longer to start stretching .
4739	2	a based on the information plastic type b is the strongest and plastic type a is the weakest . p b two ways the experimental design could be improved is to tell us the exact type of plastics and how much did the weights attached to clamp weigh .
4740	2	the two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design or validity is to dire or mujib lie and of a .
4741	2	a . a conclusion for the students data is when using the polymer plastic type d . it stretched the same amount of mm . also that type b seemed to be the best plastic because both times it was able to stretch the longest . p b . two ways this experiment could have been better is if the plastics were all starting at the same time and if the first time before the weights went on the student measured the starting length of different plastics .
4742	2	the students could have wrote down which plastic they though was going to stretch the most . and also they should of wrote down the different plastic names .
4743	2	a based on the data in both trials plastic type b was to stretchiest polymer plastic . p b . in order to improve this experiment the students should have more trials and they could use various sizes of weights .
4744	2	a my conclusion based on the student s data to plastic type b and d stretched the most . for trail b had mm and d had mm for trail b had mm and d had mm again . p b one way the student could improve the experimental design or validity of results is in the data table add how many mm the plastics were before the experiment to see how much they stretched over minutes the second way is in the data table . put in a column on how much weight they used during the experiment that way we can see how much weight it takes to stretch the polymer plastics .
4745	2	the results how that all plastics a through d stretched out after the weights were added . however there were some that stretched out more than others like plastic b . to improve the experimental design or validity the students could have mentioned in the procedure and used the same length of plastic for all types and trials . also they could have kept the amounts of weight constant through out the experiment .
4746	2	in the data it is concluded that plastic type b has the most stretchability testing at and mm . the data also shows plastic type a has the least stretchability with testing at and mm . the students could have improved the experiments design by letting more clear on the shape and size of the plastic before the weights were added . they could also doctor in the weight of the clumps .
4747	2	a plastic type b is the stretchiest while plastic type a is the least stretchy . p b the student could have done more trials . the student could have also let the plastics hang for a greater time to more accurately test their stretchability .
4748	2	a . plastic c is the most stretchable . i stretched an average of . mm while the other plastics stretched mm . mm and mm . p the student should have attached the plastic to the table with stretching more secure than tape . also they should specify the amount of weight they added to the bottom of the plastic and they should make it the same for every trial to their data accurate .
4749	2	a the students data showed that an average plastic type b was the most stretchy . p b the student could have improved by doing more trials holding the clamp on the plastic longer .
4750	2	in conclusion plastics type a the first time stretched mm the second time it stretched mm . plastic type b stretched mm second time mm . the plastic type b was the most stretched . but plastic type d was mm and the second time mm . d was close to plastic b .
4751	2	plastic b had the most stretchability in both trials with mm in trial a and mm in trial b . plastic a had the least with mm in trial a and mm in trial b . p one improvement is adding a third trial because they only had two trials and another requirement is taking the average of each plastic for comparison .
4752	2	a in conclusion plastics b and d are the more stretchable plastics compared to c and a which are less stretchable . b being the most while a being the least . p b the student could have improved the experiment design by making sure each plastic had equal length and mass also by adding equal amount of weight on a specific area of each plastic .
4753	2	a conclusion based on the data is plastic type a stretches the least t t . plastic type b stretched the most t t therefore plastic type d has best stretch ability . ways the students could have improved the experimental design was to use different because of plastic to see which brand is better and to say how many weights they are putting on the clamp .
4754	2	a in the experiment plastic b stretched the farthest at an aug of . mm . p b one way to improve the experiment would be to have a controlled or set length for the plastics instead of just saying any length which can give invalid results . next i would improve the experimental design by controlling the of weights used as well as keeping the weights as constant .
4755	2	a from looking at the data i can see that plastic b stretched the most in both trials and plastic a stretched the least in both trials . p b one way they could have improved their experimental design would be to may be do a third trial to see if you get the same thing they could do is let the plastics hang for longer .
4756	2	a in conclusion most of the plastics stretched or stayed the same in the second trial . p b two ways the experiment could have been improved was to add more than two trials to each and to test less plastics .
4757	2	a my conclusion based on these results is that plastic type b is the strongest . b to make their results bald they should ve done more trials and possibly averaged it out . plus a control would give them something to compare their results to so they re more accurate .
4758	2	a from the data i ve concluded that plastic type b had stretched the most and mm . plastic type d stretched the same both times mm plastic type c stretched mm farther the first trial and mm and plastic type a stretched mm farther the second trial and mm . p b the student could have improved this experiment by showing the original lengths of the plastics in their data and specifying how much the weights weighed and what the different plastic types were .
4759	2	in conclusion the types of plastic for t had better results than t . two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by writing out the types of plastic and to put an equal amount of weight for each plastic
4760	2	based on the students data plastic type b was the one that stretched the most after minutes . as can be seen in the data table . it stretched mm in the first trial and mm in the second trial . the only one that even reached mm in any of the two trials was plastic type d . two ways that the students could have improved this experiment is by telling them how many times to cut the plastic if it wasn t the same size as the others so that there would not be different size plastics . also the student could have said what types of weights and how much each weight weighed in the procedure so that the reader knows what kinds of weights should be used .
4761	2	a in trial one sample a stretched to mm sample b stretched to mm sample c stretched to mm and sample d stretched to mm . sample b stretched to mm sample c stretched to mm and d stretched to mm . p two ways the student could have improved the experiment design is they could have recorded their data and they could ve tried each trial carefully .
4762	2	a based on the results plastic b was the stretchiest plastic . trial one it stretched to millimeters and in trial it stretched to millimeters . p b this experiment could have been improved by adding more waits ton the plastic to see if it might have been able to stretch further . another way is to add another trial to get very accurate results .
4763	2	plastic a b both gained a length plastic c lost a length and plastic d stayed the same length . they could have done more tests with the plastics and used more plastics .
4764	2	the more the weight the less the rubber band stretched . the student could have given better information . also the student could have given more instructions for the lab .
4765	2	in conclusion to this students investigation plastic b could hold more weight for minutes and stretched the longest in millimeters for both trials . also plastic a had the lowest results throughout the experiment . to give this project a better score the student could have labeled what kinds of plastic he used . the student could have written how much weight he put on each type of plastic to give this realism .
4766	2	the conclusion is that plastic type b stretchability is the greatest where as plastic type a s stretchability is the least . p they could have improved the experiment by adding the same amount of weights by each plastic and make sure that each plastic is taped at the same length on the table so that the tape or weights would not affect the stretchability .
4767	2	in conclusion based on data that the numbers didn t make so much up or down it s were very close but t was more accurst . it showed that numbers were up except plastic type d . p one way they could have improved the design by eliminating don t need it these second they could had improved is by being more specific about number like how much lengths .
4768	2	a in conclusion we can see that plastic type b is more stretch able compared toothed types . in the two trials had and mm which is newest . p b one way they could of improved the experiment is to do same more trials . another why to improve the experiment is to specially tell us how much weight on the end of the plastic
4769	2	the conclusion that i can draw from this experiment is that some of they plastics tested weigh more than others and some after being stretched more then are don t weigh as much . p two ways the students could have improved there experiment would be to perform more than just to trails so they could have compared the data . another way they could have improved would be to try more than just four types of polymer plastics .
4770	2	a plastic type b has the stretchiest polymer type . p b the student could have improved the validity of the results by adding one more extra trial and keeping the heaviness of the weights constant .
4771	2	in conclusion plastic type b stretched the longest in minutes with mm in t and mm in t . the plastic that stretched the least with and mm is a . one way to improve the experimental design is to hang a set amount of weight from the plastic by not doing this you don t know which plastic is most durable . also you could be more careful where exactly you place the clamp placing it to high enables the plastic to fully stretch .
4772	2	a polymer b had the longest increase in length with polymer a having the shortest gain . p b he could graph the amount stretched by weight . p he could also perform more trials to get more accurate results .
4773	2	a . plastic type b stretched farther than plastic type a c and d . it stretched mm in trial and mm in trial p b . one way the students could have improved their experiment would be to add different types of weights small big . also they could measure how for each plastic stretches every minutes and see which one lasts longer .
4774	2	a the flexibility of the plastics from most to least is b d c a . b and d are probably made of branched polymers a made of cries linked polymers and c of either linear or cross linked . p b the student should have recorded the amount each plastic stretched with different weights hanging from them . she could have also put the weights back on after the first five minutes and observe how it continues to stretch recording data at several time intervals .
4775	2	a the conclusion that can be drawn based off of the student s data is plastic type b is the stretchiest out of the other plastic types . p b the two ways the student could have improved this experimental design validity of his results is by measuring exactly the same lengths for all plastics so plastic stars off longer than the other . secondly that could record how heavy enough weight is and how many they have added to the clamp .
4776	2	in the conclusion plastic type b stretched the most at of all the plastics . plastics type b stretched mm in trial and mm in trial . plastic type a was the least stretchy because in trail in stretched mm and trail mm . the students can improve their validity by telling what the starting length was . also they should of said how much weight to add .
4777	2	at the end of the polymer investigation type a stretched the most starting with mm and stretching to mm . type d didn t stretch at all and type c actually got shorter starting at mm and ending with mm . two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by starting off with all the same length of plastic . another way to improve the experiment is by adding in the procedure how much weight to hang on the clamp .
4778	2	based on the students data i was able to com to a conclusion see that plastic types a through c were able to stretch decrease from both trials . now plastic type d wasn t it remain the same limit in trial as it reacted in trial .
4779	2	my conclusion based on the students data is plastic b s stretchability is more greater than the other plastics tasted . two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is they could have two prop s stretch the plastic and measure at to see how long it stretched . they could have also added more weight to the clamps .
4780	2	a . the conclusion i would draw based on the student s data is that plastic type b stretched the longest than any other plastic . plastic type c stretched mm and then the second trial is decreased by mm . plastic type d stretched mm and for trial it stayed the same . plastic type a stretched mm and increased by mm . p b . the two ways the students could have improve the experimental design is that be more precise will there procedure and name the plastic type . also tell us what to use to measure the length .
4781	2	according to the data i have collected the plastic that stretched the most was plastic b . plastic b went from mm in the first trial to mm in the second trial . plastic c really ought my attention however because it went from mm in the first trials to mm in the second meaning it shrunk . some validity issues were that they didn t tell you what kind of plastic they used instead they labeled it with letters . another validity issue is that the group didn t give the first measurement of the plastic so you could see the change in the first trial .
4782	2	i think it was a lab that was they were doing .
4783	2	after the polymer investigation i can conclude that plastic type a was the strongest polymer considering stretchability . this is because of the four plastics tested a was the least permanently stretched and underwent the least plastic deformation . this it is the most elastic polymer and b with quite opposite results the least elastic stretchable . this experiment could ve been made better by recording the initial length of each plastic in the data table and by including the average amount stretched of each plastic to improve validity .
4784	2	based on the data plastic type b is the most durable meaning that it has the most stretchability . in trial b stretches mm . in trial it stretches mm . the students could have improved the experiment design also the validity
4785	2	a according to the data plastic type b could stretch the farthest and plastic type a could stretch the least far . p b one way to improve the experiment would be to add the weights to the clamps at time instruments rather than add randomly in a time period as minutes . for example the first weight would get put on once the timer started and after an seconds another weight would be added and this process would continue . this would help the validity of the experiment because it is to going the highest as a controlled result . another way to improve this experiment would be to keep length of each plastic type constant . this would keep the length as a controlled variable and thus improve the validity of the experiment .
4786	2	a in conclusion in both trials plastic type a was stretched the least and plastic type b was stretched the most p one way they could have improved their experiment they could have added more trials . another way is that they could have described the weights a little more in step so their experiment can be repeated as similar as possible .
4787	2	plastic type a is the least flexible while plastic type b was the most flexible plastic . the students could have added different weights that may have been heavier or lighter . they also could have recorded the weights of the plastic .
4788	2	from the students results i can tell that plastic type b is strongest material and plastic type a is the weakest . the students could have done one or two more test to further improve reliability of their results and he she could have also written down the amounts of weights put on each type of plastic that caused it to break .
4789	2	a . based on the recorded data of the polymer investigation experiment i come to the conclusion that that type b polymer plastic had greatest amount of stretchability because after all four of the sample polymers were tested under exact same conditions and sample b stretched the furthest length a length of cm . p b . in step he should state that the weight must be identical as to ensure all plastics are tested in an identical manner . they should also state in step one that plastics must be the same length . if the plastics are shorter they will actually be stronger due to leverage and that would affect validity .
4790	2	a conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type b can be stretched the further . the students could ve improved his experiment by adding more trials and finding an average .
4791	2	based on the students data from trial and it has been proven that polymer plastic b can withstand being stretched the digest . in both trials plastic b was superior to the others by holding and mm in wright . these students could improve their validity and design by adding key information to the procedure . for example in step by giving the exact dimensions of the plastic being cut can allow all the trials to follow to be constant . another way to improve you experiment is to let the reader in step if you add the weights one at a time or all at once and then let mm pass .
4792	2	a based on the students data plastic a in trial had mm went up to mm in t . plastic b trial had e went up to just in t . plastic c had mm in trial went down one to mm in t . plastic d stayed the same for t t . p b the students should of tried another trial and they should of also had another different type of plastic .
4793	2	a in our conclusion type b plastic work the best . it had the most stretchability in both trials . p b they could of made a graph for the experiment to make it easier to dear starve .
4794	2	based on the student s data plastic type b was the the polymer because it stretched the largest . one way the students could have improved their experiment was to write down how much each weight weighed for . also they could of left the weights on the polymers a little longer .
4795	2	a the student improved their experiment every time .
4796	2	in trial polymer bags stretched the most than other bags . p the students could have completed more trials . they could of been more specific with the type of weight .
4797	2	my conclusion based on the data provided is plastic type a had the best durability because it didn t stretch as much as the other did . two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by adding more trials to the process and to give brand names of the plastics .
4798	2	a plastics a and b stretched farther the second time but plastic c stretched less . plastic d stretched the same distance for both trials . plastic d stretched the furthest out of all the plastics . plastic d is the stretchiest out of all the plastics and plastic a is the least stretchy . p b the students could have improved their experiment by adding the same amount of weight to all of the plastics . they could have also done another trial b to make sure their results were valid .

4800	2	plastic type b is the stretchiest type of plastic with t stretching mm and t stretching mm . temperature the validity of the experiment the students could have tested the plastics with more or less weights attached . they also could have mentioned the stretch over more or less time .
4801	2	a . plastic b was able to stretch the most . p b . more trials more types of plastic .
4802	2	. breed on the student s data the amount stretched mm has more than . p two ways the students could have improved the experiment could be use the same amount of weight put with different types of objects or whatever they used .
4803	2	at the end of the polymer investigation the students data concludes that plastic type b was the stretchiest plastic measured . one way this experiment s design of results could ve been improved would have been to check the thickness of the different plastics because that would effect how for they stretch . another way this experiment could ve been improved would be to check the date at which the plastics were manufactured because after time and different environments some materials may be in better or worse condition which would affect its strength and stretchability .
4804	2	a i conclude that polymers b stretched the farthest trial and . also that polymers a stretched the least farthest out of all the polymers . p b there are many ways the students could have improved their experiment . for example they could have listed the polymers they used . also they could have done more trials .
4805	2	conclusion based on the data found in trial plastic type b was stretched the furthest and plastic type a was not as flexible as type b . p one way the student could have better described the procedure was say how much the waits weighed . and the student could have added more trials to get better validity in the data .
4806	2	in conclusion the students investigated four different polymer plastics for stretchability . plastic a in trial stretched mm and in trial it stretched mm . plastic b in trial stretched mm and in trial it stretched mm . plastic c in trial stretched mm and in trial it stretched mm and finally plastic d stretched mm in trial and in trial it stretched mm . the two ways that the students can improve is add a control and more trials .
4807	2	i conclude that plastic type a is the best plastic because it stretched the least of all the plastics . this shows that it is the strongest because with the same weight this one was capable of talking them the easiest . one way they could improve their experimental design is by making sure all of the sample basis were the same length . this is so we know the outcome isn t changed by the different sizes . they also should have said the exact weight of the weights so the experiment could be replicated .
4808	2	a . during trial the results were about the same and the plastic containers stretched further then the first trial . p the way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing the experiment over again also the student could have used more plastic samples for this experiment .
4809	2	a . plastic type b had the most stretchability stretching mm on the st trial and mm on the nd trial . plastic type d had the second most stretching power followed by c and then a . p b . two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results would be to conduct more trials for better validity and they should mention the amount of weight in each bag .
4810	2	this experiment is useful in many ways and it is also a good way to see which plastic was the least stretchable and which one was the most stretchable . one way to improve this experiment is by saying the number of weights that should be put on . another way is that it should say much each weight has to weigh .
4811	2	a for the most part in t the plastic type are the same length or longer . p b . one way the student could have improved the experimental design is by add about more minutes to the second trial so see more of a length difference . for the results the students should made a graph to see the results better .
4812	2	to conclude plastic a is the best for stretching for example plastic a stretch to mm while plastic b c stretched to mm and plastic d didn t stretched . p they could improve their experiment by adding more trials and adding the same amount of weight to each type of bags .
4813	2	a based on the data i would say that the test was not as valid as it could be . p b to make it more valid they could have said to get plastic samples of all the same size because a bigger peace might hold weight better .
4814	2	conclusion a student conducted this experiment in order to find out which of the four polymer plastics can stretch the longest a b c d . looking at the data table it shows that polymer plastic b stretched out the longest with a measurement of . mm on t and a measurement of mm on t . this student could ve improved the experimental design by being more specific in step . by adding how long the sample was suppose to be . also for step by adding how much weight is needed for this experiment .
4815	2	a . by the students hanging the plastic sample down the side of the table putting a clamp on it and adding weights to it made the plastic stretch for a and b . for c the stretching went down mm and for d it stayed at mm . p b . two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to add a third trial so we could see if the plastic would stretch more . also they could have said how much the weights weighed because that could make a difference .
4816	2	my conclusion from the student s experiment is that plastic type d is the strongest because in both trials shown it was stretched the longest . two ways they could have improved the experiment are they could have improved the experiment are they could have done more trials for accuracy and they could have included the different types of plastics used grocery bag sandwich bag plastic wrap garbage bag etc .
4817	2	they should do a lot of trial on there experiment . i think that the plastic type stretched the most out of all of them .
4818	2	based on the student s data i can conclude that plastic type a is the most durable of the four plastics . in both trials it stretched the least meaning that the polymer stretchability is not the great . on the other hand plastic type b has the most stretchability because it stretched out the most compared to the other three . if i were to carry a large package i would use polymer b because it will not break and it stretches the farthest . two ways the students could have improved the validity of the results would be to write down the measurements of each plastic with no weights and to conduct more trials . by doing this you are showing the comparison between before and after and by doing more trials you are making your data more accurate and valid .
4819	2	one conclusion that can draw based on the data is the reacting the per data plastic type b was stretched the longest amount of millimeters . the students could have improved the validity of their experiment by adding more trials so if can they would do more data to support a by potentials . another way this experiment could be improved is making sure that all of the plastic samples are the same length and weight because they could also add or take away from the stretches or some trials .
4820	2	a they put a piece of tape of the the end of the table the part that was hanging they added weights the preceded this procedure twice and come up with cook below t succeeded . p b they could have tested different weight numbers or they could of test the point of how long the tape wiz and how long it ended up at the end with weights .
4821	2	a . based on the students data plastic type b stretched the most with mm . while the second close plastic which is d only stretch mm . p b . the student could ve had more trials also a control to improve the experiment .
4822	2	a conclusion type b is the most weakest type c is nd strongest type a is the strongest . p b they could have cut down on the time minutes is a little to much minutes would be good and they should have done more trials .
4823	2	the purpose of the lab was to test four different polymers plastic for stretchability . in conclusion plastic b did indeed held the most weight . in trial an trial . plastic b stretched mm and mm . the weakest plastic was plastic a which in trial only stretched mm and trial only stretched mm . plastic c was nd strongest stretching mm in trial and in trial . while plastic d was the nd strongest stretching mm in the st and nd trial . two ways the student could ve improved the experimental design are he could ve had longer time period to hold the weights and he could ve more than trials .
4824	2	a based on the trial from the student
4825	2	a plastic type b stretches the most while type a stretches the least . p b the student should have used the same amount of weights for each one . the length of plastic one should be the same . the amount of tape used should be the same constant could had a control group .
4826	2	in conclusion if you test four different polymer plastic for stretchability plastic type b stretched an average of . mm while plastic type a stretched an average of plastic type was . mm and plastic type d was mm . one way the student could improved the experimental design are more accurate . also the student should have included measurement in their procedure we know the plastic starting length and the amount of weight added .
4827	2	a . the students have concluded that plastic sample b is the most durable with and mm in both trials . the least durable plastic sample would be plastic sample a because it only got and mm between both trials . p b . two ways that the students could have improve their experiment would be to specify the amount of weight they are adding in the clamps . finally the students should perform more trials so they have the best results .
4828	2	in results plastic type b has stretched the farthest type d stretched the second farthest type c stretched the third farthest and type a stretched the smallest . in conclusion plastic type b length was the most t and t .
4829	2	a based on my data chart i found that plastic sample b stretches out the most out of the four plastics i sampled .
4830	2	. the students should make a different data table and not the same so the experiment could show that is showing a different way of the procedure . p . i think that the steps of the procedure should include more details and have a closing conclusion to show how the experimental group had ended .
4831	2	based on the student s data i am able to conclude that plastic type b stretched the most out of all the types and therefore is the most stretchable . one way the students could have improved the experimental design would be to test different amounts of time being stretched . another way would be to do an additional trial so it would be instead of increase the validity of the results .
4832	2	plastic type b snatched the most using this experiment . one way to improve the results would be to do another trial because the inconsistent results could be settled by a third trial . another thing to improve the experiment would be to have equal mm length of plastic and then have the weight clamp stretched because that could have an effect such as the sensed weight pulling down so all sure length of something like mm .
4833	2	a . a student performed the following investigation to test four different polymer plastic for stretchability . in conclusion type b stretched the longest length . p b . two way the could improve the experimental design is by telling what brand the plastic is and by telling how much the mass of weights and keep constant and more trials .
4834	2	a after this experiment the data shows that in both trials plastic type b was the plastic that had the most amount stretchability . the chart shows that plastic b stretched mm in trial and mm in trial . this was the most length any of the four plastics stretched . so plastic b would ve be most stretchable . b however this experiment could be improved . first of all he could have been specific by stating in his procedure how much the weights was and how many . for example recorded how much the plastic would stretch before it broke . secondly the students should have stated in the data original length and the length it was affecting weights .
4835	2	base on the students data i can conclude that most accurate plastic type was d the amount stretched o for t and t mm . p two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is that they should have done trials so it can be more reliable and they could have drawn a graph to have more validity .
4836	2	a . in conclusion plastic type b was the stretchiest plastic for the trials . plastic b stretched mm for trial and mm for trial while plastic a stretched only mm for trial and mm for trial . p b . two ways the student could have improved the experimental design could be in the procedure to tell how much tape to use to hold down the plastic and to tell us if you are supposed to use the same pieces of plastic for trial or a different piece .
4837	2	a conclusion based on the student s data is that plastic type stretch the most according to the two trials . one way the student could have improved the experimental design was to provide the beginning length before the plastic is stretched because it is important to see in comparison to no beginning length how much it stretched . one way the student could have improved the validity of the results was to conduct a third trial because plastic a b c all had different stretch amounts in millimeters from trial to trial
4838	2	according to the results of the lab plastic type b stretched the most stretching mm on trial one and mm on trial two . plastic type a is the most durable stretching the least plastic type a stretched mm in trial one and mm on trial two . p the design of the experiment could be improved if more types of plastic were used in the experiment . p the validity of the experiment could be improved if the students specified the exact types of bags they used in the experiment glad sandwich bay .
4839	2	a polymer a is more durable because it stretched the least on the trials . p b the students should do more than trials . they should also measure the arm . of weight they re putting on the plastic as it was not specified .
4840	2	when processing through this experiment most plastics at the end showed improvement . plastic type d was the only one that didn t change its length . in the second trial plastic c went down from mm to mm . and plastics a b raised up two measurements . this experiment can be re capable but it wouldn t turn out as the same measurements . they students could of explained correctly what you had to repeat and do with the other three plastics . and at least name the plastic to give you more understandable and knowledge to improve their design .
4841	2	based on the student s data polymer plastic a has the highest tensile strength with an average of only mm stretched . the next closest and strongest is polymer c with an average of . mm stretched . d is the weakest than those two with mm stretched and the weakest polymer plastic is b with . mm stretched on average . one way this experiment could have been improved is to specify how heavy the weights were constant . also to increase validity the student could have had all the polymer plastics stare this experiment as all the same length and width maybe this would affect the ability to stretch .
4842	2	the conclusion i reached using the student s data is that plastic b stretched the most to millimeters while plastic a stretched the least at only mm . one way they could have improved their experiment would be to specify how trendy the weights should be and how long each piece of plastic should be . the second thing they could have done was conduct a third trial to make sure their data is valid .
4843	2	based on the student s data polymer b its the weakest polymer because it stretched the most . one way the student could improve this experiment is by having more trials . more trials will give the student more valid data . another way the student can improve this experiment is by testing the strength of the polymer with different amounts of weight . having heavier or lighter weights could tell the student exactly how much weight the polymer can withstand before it breaks .
4844	2	a the stretchiest type of plastic is b . the least stretchiest type of plastic is type a . b the student could ve heated the plastic pieces a little bit call to the same temperature so that his observations would have been more noticeable . he would also want to make sure that in the beginning all the pieces of plastic had the same length and thickness .
4845	2	two way their investigations would improve is by adding the control the weights .
4846	2	plastic type d is the strongest . they could have told us the conclusion . they could have also made the data table easier the read .
4847	2	a . the conclusion would be that even though they stretched some look to short . but impressed because b and d plastic types stretched a lot . p b . the student could have improved by using more weights or heavier weights . instead of using the table as the base the student could have done it in a totally different way like using his hand or hanging it from the window or roof .
4848	2	at the end the students can conclude that plastic type b stretches the most . also two ways the students could have improved their experiment results is by adding a third trial and by making sure the same pressure being put to stretch each plastic is used each time .
4849	2	a i conclude that plastic type b had the most stretchability due to the fact that it has higher numbers on both trials . p b one way the students could have improved the experimental design is by trying different types of plastic to see the stretchability compared to each other . another way they could have improved it is by telling us the amount of time they stretched the plastic for .
4850	2	a . the students may have had a few errors between trials to get such different results except for d . p b . the students could have said how much of the plastic should be taped down because otherwise the differing of plastic taped down can change the trial length . they should have used something different than a clamp because the clamp could potentially break off a piece of plastic .
4851	2	a . my conclusion is that plastic type b has more stretchability than the other plastic types because in both trials plastic type b had more stretchability than the other plastic types . p b . the students could have improved their experiment by performing trials instead of . they also could of did a line graph instead of a two table so that people could get a better idea of how much the plastic types stretch .
4852	2	plastic type b stretched the most . the student could of improved the experiment by adding more trials and by giving the names of the plastics .
4853	2	based on the students data it can be concluded that in order from most stretchy to least it would be type b d c then a . type b had a higher stretch average of . m while a had a low aug . at . they could have improved validity by measuring the over intervals of line for example they could have it every minutes for minutes . and they could have improved the experiment by using the same length for plastic a b c d . instead of just measuring the sample .
4854	2	a plastic type b was the the most stretchable stretching mm . plastic a was the least stretchable only reaching mm when stretched . p b the student should have measured the lengths of the plastics and not them . in the same length so the people following it won t have to have more measurements and confusion . next the student should have added the same amount of weights and same measurement of weights to each clamp because g would stretch plastic less than g so the dates might not be reliable .
4855	2	the second trick t stretched move than t . p the student didn t tell us what kind of plastic to use . they didn t say how much to put on
4856	2	a a conclusion i can draw based on the a data is that in the second trial it didn t stretch that much father than the first trial . p b two ways the experiment could have been improved is if they used different types of plastic and measured which are stretched the most . another way is they should have added the same amount of weights .
4857	2	by adding weights to a plastic cup with a clamp under for a certain time they found a measurement of the plastics . p to improve the experiment they could have determined what kind of plastic . they also could have let it hang for a longer time .
4858	2	a conclusion that could be drawn from the data is that plastic type a had the best results and there stretched the most in both trials . two ways the student could improve the experiment is by repeating the steps again and having a rd trial for better accuracy and then even add in another plastic type to really see which kind stretches better .
4859	2	based on the student s table i d conclude that plastic a is the least stretchiest . it only stretched to be mm the first trial and mm the second trial . also that plastic b is the stretchiest seeing that is stretched to mm t and mm t . the student could have improved his her experiment by setting a specific length to start with for each plastic to allow readers to see the difference . also the student should specify how much weight to add and the weight of the clamp .
4860	2	the conclusion of the student s data is that plastic type b stretched the most . it s first trial it stretched mm and the second trial it stretched mm . plastic type a didn t stretched the most . it only stretched mm on its first trial and mm on it s second trial . p two ways the students could of improved their experimental design would be to do a third trial and have the clamp attached to the plastic for minutes instead of the minutes .
4861	2	a . although certain plastics are different you can only stretch them so far . also with stretching the same type of plastic twice . the measurement is not gonna change drastic ally . p be you could add another trial to create a more accurate data form . also you could lengthen or shorten the amount of time you are stretching the plastic .
4862	2	the students data shows that the most stretchable plastic is plastic type b . two ways that the experiment could have been improved is to do it again . also the students should have made sure all of the plastics were the same length before experimenting on it .
4863	2	based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type b stretches the furthest and plastic type a stretches the least furthest . the student could have improved the experimental design by doing more trials of each and then finding an average . she also could have made things more constant and specify by stating trials as the amount of plastic used to be held down to the table or how heavy the weights were .
4864	2	a a conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type b stretched the farthest in both trials . p b the student could have improved the experimental design of the validity of the results by doing more trials and by adding another control .
4865	2	the conclusion to that the type a plastic stretched more than the others because stretch more mm than the other ones .
4866	2	a plastic d stretched the furthest . p b the student should have included the starting length and width . these both should be held constant . also for each trial the student should make one trial have a weight of . this gives the experiment range for more variability and accuracy .
4867	2	a based on the data the plastic type b stretches the most . p b they should have said to make all plastics same length p should have specified the amount of weight .
4868	2	a . plastic type d had the greatest stretchability . p b . to improve the experiment design and or the validity of the results of this experiment the students could have added more constant variables . constant variable ensure that your data is valid by improving your experimental design with the same procedures . also a control could be added . a control allows students to compare their data to the normal standards independent variable only . these factors improve an experiment .
4869	2	a after performing the experiment the students could conclude that sample b was the most stretchable reaching mm on the first try and on the second and that sample a was the least stretchable reaching mm and mm . p b they could have explained what kind of weights to use and they should measure it while its hanging so they know for sure how long it can stretch
4870	2	b . use the same but not used polymer plastics because the ones that were used already were being tested during the experiment and they used them again for the second trial so use the same but new polymer plastics . p also to add the same amount of weights for the plastic and to do another trial with more weight .
4871	2	my conclusion to this student s data would be that plastic b had the most stretchability . one thing i would change in the experimental plan would be that i would of used only one type of weights brand is to use as my constant control the their thing i would change is i would let t sit for min and see if there is more of a change in data .
4872	2	based on the data plastic type stretched the most it stretched to mm as the first trial mm on the second trial plastic type b stretched the second most . p b . state how much weight could have a stretch used and the plastics are being used .
4873	2	each plastic type stretches more than the previous one . type a and c seemed to be the strongest because they only stretched and inches while b and d stretched and inches . two ways the student could have improved the experiment are to have a third trial and be specific on how much weight the student added .
4874	2	the conclusion based on the data is that plastic type b has the most stretchability because it stretched the greatest while d was the second most c was the third most and a was the least stretchable . the first way this experiment could be improved is if each type of plastic had the same specific starting length so that one length didn t stretch easier than another . also the weights added to the clamp should be identified specifically so the experiment can be repeated .
4875	2	the students could have performed more trials . p the students could have used more than one plastic .
4876	2	a . the students can conclude that plastic type b is the most stretchable and plastic type a is the least stretchable . plastic type b stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least . p b . one way the students can improve their experiment is by stating the amount of weights in pounds in step . it is important to know how much weight is being added . a second way to improve the experiment is by doing additional trials with heavier weights in order to see how much the plastics can stretch .
4877	2	a based on the results i ve concluded that plastic b can be stretched the most . p b one way to improve the validity of the results is to make sure the starting length for all four polymers are the same . the second way to improve the validity is to use the same amount of weights for all four polymers .
4878	2	i can conclude that plastic type b has stated the most because . two way the students can improve their experimental is to name plastics and have constants in their experiment .
4879	2	a it seems that the results make sense . plastic b d were clearly the most flexible and the others were not . b was the most flexible altogether . p b he could have had a control to base the experiment off of . he could try different amounts of weights on the plastics .
4880	2	a after trying out all the polymer plastics twice first trial the highest it a stretched was while the second trial was different the highest it stretched was . they were both plastic type b . it seem like it stretched more on trial but also less and equals for the others type of plastic . p b one way they could or improve was to do third trial . p second way explain how much weights do we need to use .
4881	2	how does t affects t . my conclusion plastic b has more stretchability then the others .
4882	2	from looking at the results of the polymer investigation lab i conclude that plastic type b has the most stretchability in both trials it stretched the most out of all the other plastics . p one way the experiment could be improved if at the beginning of trial all the plastics are cut at the same length . if they start off being the same length comparing the results would be easier and more accurate . another way to improve the lab is to use something stronger than tape to hold the plastic . with tape the plastic a the weights most likely even fall .
4883	2	based on the student s data . i can conclude that plastic b had the most stretchability . i can conclude this because in both trial and the plastic stretched more than the others . the student s could have improved the experimental design . one way is they could have added more trials . another way is they could of said the type of plastic they were using . this is how they could of improved their experimental design .
4884	2	they should of named the different type of plastic and could of double check there measurements .
4885	2	based on the students data plastic type b was able to be stretched the most . two ways that the student could have improved his results and the experimental design was by timing the time it took for them to stretch and changing it either shortening it or raising it . also the student could have drawn a graph to better validity their results .
4886	2	a based on the students data the plastics didn t have much of a difference from trial to trial . p b the student could have improved the experimental validity by measuring each plastic the same length and adding more trials .
4887	2	in conclusion out of the types of plastic used for the experiment plastic type b stretched the longest . the data shows that from trial and plastic type b measured ton and . two ways a student could have done to improve the experimental design is performing at least or more trials because the results may not be credible . also i would measure the weights put on the plastic to make sure its done evenly .
4888	2	a plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic type . a is the least stretchable . p they could have done more than two trials .
4889	2	for t and t for the types of plastic it stays around the same area in mm . so i think the amount stretched is correct . p b two way the student could have improved the experiment is by maybe the nd time leaving it longer than five minutes . another change could have been to see what made it different the second time .
4890	2	a based on the results plastic type b had the greatest elasticity with an average length of mm . the least elastic plastic was plastic a with an average length of mm . p b . make all plastic begin at the same length . p . specify how much weight is to be added and make it a controlled variable .
4891	2	a the results ranged very closely in numbers from trial and but plastic type d stretched the most . p b the students should have done at last one more trial and could have averaged cut the results for each plastic type .
4892	2	plastic type b has the most amount stretched where plastic type a has the least . the student could have improved her experiment by being more clear when it came to the procedure and by organizing the procedure .
4893	2	a . there is wide variation in the stretchability of these polymers . b . they should have used a set amount of weight instead of varying it . they should have put the polymers to a specific sites . for example all polymers should have been cm by cm by cm . this way you eliminate variation .
4894	2	plastic b was the most stretched on both trials therefore i conclude that it is the most stretchiest than the others . plastic a was the one that less stretched and there fore is the less stretchiest of all . plastic a is the strongest because it didn t stretch fastest and b is the weakest because it stretched the most in minutes . the student could have done another trial . the student as well have done different time periods such as minutes . th student could have also say the amounts of weight put on .
4895	2	a could conclusion could be that plastic type d had the most amount that was stretched . p also two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is p . let the weights hang longer . p . more trials .
4896	2	after holding weight the plastic has stretched to be longer . p always are how much weight and ran more trials .
4897	2	a in conclusion plastic d is harder to stretch than plastic plastic a . plastic d stayed the same as plastic a stretched mm more during t than in t . p b the student could have improve their experiment by adding a third trial and along us average to base their findings off of . also they could have said how much weight to add in each plastic .
4898	2	the student s amounts were not that far apart from each other they were off by or until d when they were both equal with . ways this student could ve improved the experimental design was to do the second trial a little bit different from the first trial to get better results and increase the time on maybe how long the student had her sample hanging .
4899	2	in conclusion more of the t have a high record then t . two way improved the experimental are measure length differently and types of plastic .
4900	2	to let the plastic hens longer put more weights on it .
4901	2	the student to test the stretchability of different polymer plastics by taking a sample of on plastic measuring it and and then taping it to the table and adding weights to the plastic and letting it hang for min then measure the ending length . the student noticed that plastic be did the best in both trials with mm in the first and mm in the nd . plastic d was the next best with and followed by plastic c . plastic a did the worse with mm and mm . two ways the student could be improved their experimental design was to say the starting length and how many weights was used .
4902	2	a plastic type b was the most stretchable plastic out of four plastic a b c d materials and plastic type a was the least stretchable plastic . b the students could have improved the experience by repeating the exact same experience again . the students could also have compared to other students who have done the same experience to see how accurate difference they have .
4903	2	a plastics a c are the least flexible while b c are the most . p b they could have done another trial added a variable
4904	2	a conclusion based on the students data is that they were trying to see which plastic is the strongest . the strongest is plastic b . p two ways that the students could have the experimental design is by putting the more of the plastic . also put the time .
4905	2	two ways that the student could improve his experiment is by first do a few more than just trials maybe would be good . also make sure that all the plastic samples are the same length before stretching .
4906	2	plastic b is the most stretchable plastic . the student could have improved the experimental design by using more detail . the student could have improved the validity of the results by .
4907	2	they could ve measure or weighed how much weight they were going to add .
4908	2	a . sample b and d performed about twice as well as samples a and c . p b . the students could have described how the weights should be distributed and how should the tape be put on the plastic wrap at the top .
4909	2	based on the data chart the conclusion that can be drawn are when the plastic type d was stretched both times during the trials they stayed the same . two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by doing another head so their data can be accurate and using different types of plastic .
4910	2	a a conclusion to the students data is the more the plastic type was putted the long it stretched . p b the student could of did make trials also they could of took the three highest stretched plastic and did a experiment finding out which plastic stretched the longest out of the three .
4911	2	based on the data of the student plastic type d has the best stretchability and plastic type a has the worst to improve the experiment the children should have measure a plastic bag without clamp as a control to compare data also another way to improve or validate data was to do another trial .
4912	2	a plastic type a seems to be the most durable judging by the fact that it only stretched mm in total . p they could have added more trials and they could have specified if they added the weights in the same order every time .
4913	2	if he didn t do the same exact trial twice then he wouldn t get almost the exact same data . one way he could on changed it is by doing a different trial . should of told us what are the polymer plastics for stretchability .
4914	2	a . plastic type b is the most stretchable . p b . add a control specify how much weight to put on the clamps .
4915	2	based on the results of the student data results it is clear that no one of the polymer had much of a difference concerning how much they stretched the most one polymers was mm which isn t that much . to improve the experiment the student could have used heavier weights for a more accurate measurement . because the weights that were used didn t seem to have much of an effect . the student also could have found out what each type of polymer was before they started their experiment .
4916	2	a based on the data plastic b was the most stretch capable plastic and plastic a was the least stretchable a was the least stretchable . p b two ways the student could have improved the design would have been by measuring the lengths of the plastic types before removing the weights and by performing a third trial to validity the results .
4917	2	the experiment isn t valid because there are i v s which means you can draw the conclusion because they stretched the same plastic . i i be so it you draw a conclusion you draw the difference between the two trials but other than that you can t draw the conclusion . if they would have how did the second trial when it would have worked .

10866	4	the word invasive is very significant to the article . rob roy macinnes opinion of the word is unfair and that the word is passing judgement . maybe we as humans are being invasive disturbing the natural barriers of the animals .
10868	4	the word invasive is important to the article because it informs the reader that not only is the a species not native but it is taking over its new environment .
10869	4	even the term invasive species is unfair . the significance is big because it labels the animal as something bad which gives you a second thought about these animals . i don t think it is unfair because animals like snakes are very dangerous .
10871	4	the significant of the word invasive means passing judgement in paragraph it says invasive is a passing judgement .
10872	4	looking for danger finding hungry and .
10873	4	the significance of the word invasive is that its use to describe the animals as union al species to have as pet . it makes the article more interesting because its stating that these animals are scary and dangerous and can be harmful if not checked by pro great na ls .
10877	4	word invasive is one of the word that is important among three articles in the first the author introduced reptile pets that are not native as invasive since they break the diversity . also in second article the invasive species are now expanding throughout countries which can threat native animals too . this ties up with the idea of generalist and specialist on third article because now days the invasive animals are being generalists which can live better .
10878	4	the word invasive means that species that aren t unchecked by natural predators and people think that they are major threats to biodiversity because a lot of people don t really care about the python species and macinnes stated that the term invasive species is just a passing judgement people like to make .

10921	4	the significance of the word invasive is that it talks about animals people hardly see . in paragraph macinnes said that even the term invasive species is unfair . they re introduced . so in conclusion invasive is another way of saying introduced .
10922	4	invasive means like invaded so the significance of this article is that you shouldn t invade the animals habitat .
10926	4	invasive is important to the article because the story is about invasive species like pythons in america . some people disagree with invasive however even the term invasive species is unfair he said they re introduced . i think that invasive is passing judgement achenbach .
10927	4	invasive means they invade . in this case their saying that the species reptiles are invading and pointing into others territory .
10929	4	invasive is meaning that they are not naturally living here they were introduced by something and in this case it was humans . the invasive species cause threats to the environment because they have no natural predator so they can reproduce rapidly with out being harmed .
10930	4	invasive is significant to the rest of the article because its a wonderful introduction . they believe its the best thing to happen to the everglades .
10933	4	the significance of the word invasive i think is that just by hearing the word sounds bad or dangerous and in the article it stated paragraph . even the term invasive species is unfair . it also said that the word invasive is a passing judgement .
10934	4	invasive basically means harmful to society of it wouldn t be good for the species itself . like a python living in the cold he would die .
10937	4	the word invasive essentially means being relocated to a new habitat . invasive is significant to the rest of the article because the python is an invasive animal since it did not travel by itself from asia it was brought over by humans and was forced to adapt .
10939	4	the significance of the word invasive it means like stretching like the python habitat stretching from california to delaware and including much of the south .
10940	4	the significance of the word invasive in the article is that macinnes is a seller of invasive animals but he says even the term invasive species is unfair he also states they re introduced .
10941	4	i think the word invasive means something good something unique . these animals are something special and can do things that we can not . people have to home these reptiles in there house holds . million house holds contain able salt one reptile .
10942	4	invasive is that their an aware pythons an invasive to certain areas a trying into new locations and found ways .
10943	4	invasive means to judge for example in the article it see invasive species that unfair .
10944	4	the word invasive was used to describe the python in paragraph the word was used to show how the python was invading climates that it was never intended to be in and it is causing major trouble s in these climates because there are no predators to eat there .
10945	4	the significance of the word invasive is that some animals are going into lands where they shouldn t be . they are being imported to other land .
10946	4	invasive is a keyword in the article because it is a word used to describe certain reptiles . the word has a negative connotation to it implying overpopulation . the population of reptiles is spreading as a result of people keeping them as pets . this is causing problems in florida as strange things are now happening with these animals . for example alligators and pythons who have likely become invasive began eating each other . the are too many of them to survive .
10948	4	i think the word invasive is passing judgement . also the word is the introduced you to everything . someone stated to me it s a wonderful introduction . i think it s the best thing to happen to the everglades in the last years .
10949	4	the word evasive means animals that have not been unchecked by natural predator means to the rest of the world that most other animals around the world that we don t know about .
10950	4	the word invasive is used numerous times in the article and is significant . it is significant because while soles believe these different species are invasive others such as macinnes feel the term is passing judgement . the term invasive is important because it can help determine point of view within the article .
10952	4	the word invasive is an animal that is overestimated to be a threat . such as a snake lizard or other reptiles .

10959	4	invasive is when a species not normally in a certain place or environment become abundant there . the burmese pythons are intrusive to florida as they are not native to that place . they are also causing the extinction of they key largo wood rat .
10964	4	the significance of the word invasive is invasive species people almost think that these animals are bad and very harmful .
10965	4	the word inside is used significantly because pythons move around and adapt to other environments . the article says organisms move around other environment but not this fast .
10966	4	the significance of the word invasive to the article is to show how they are calling these animals .
13360	5	. the mrna is translated into trna . the codons on the trna are translated into different amino acids . . the amino acids form together to create a protein .
13361	5	. history splits the dna and mrna attached . mrna carries information to the amino acid sequence . trna attached to the mrna strand creating a new strand . the new strand goes through the ribosomes creating protein
13362	5	mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to trna . from there trna carries the amino acid sequence for the protein . the codons then attach . the amino acid chain is then in place .
13363	5	trna rrna
13364	5	ribosome creating proteins going through mitosis again cell respiration and evolution
13365	5	the first step involved in protein synthesis is when the mrna unzips the dna strand . secondly each nucleotide adeline quinine thine and cytosis is paired with another nucleotide . adeline pairs with thine and quinine with cytosis . lastly as the mrna pairs the nucleotide bases two new dna strands are formed .
13366	5	the mrna will first take protein to the nucleus . then it will send it to the trna . the trna transport will then send it to the body .
13367	5	the mrna bonds with an amino acid and they form a new sequence of dna . the mrna then releases and brings the new sequence back to be analyzed . these processes are known as transcription .
13368	5	transported to rrna .
13369	5	protein synthesis one is to build of course that what synthesis means to build .
13370	5	dna to mrna then to trna then to a protein
13371	5	it has to make sure everything is in order . then it goes back through the pore the hole it comes in and out of . then is starts the process all over again after the protein has been created .
13372	5	it attached to trna
13373	5	. the mrna carries instructions from the nucleus to the amino acid sequences of a protein . . it converts the protein into energy . . changes the protein molecules . . atp is used to make the proteins energy .
13374	5	st thing that happens is prophase and they separate . nd anaphase at which they breakup rd prophase they split . th metaphase they operate .
13375	5	the four major steps for the protein synthesis is involved with trna rrna mrna and finally enters into meiosis .
13376	5	anaphase telophase prophase metaphase
13377	5	gets bacteria out of the body to stay healthy gets nutrition to the body to stay healthy gets viruses out of the body so you dont get sick helps the body to get immune to certain things
13378	5	prophase where the cells are still attached but are not connected at the ends . metaphase where they all meet in the middle . anaphase when they are staring to divide . telophase where you finally have two individually .
13379	5	rrna hold the mrna in place trna pairs the codon with an anticodon and amino acid another trna comes and attached its anticodon nd an amino acid the first trna leaves but attached it s amino acid to the second amino acid and so on .
13380	5	the ionic code get s the t s changed to us with makes it ready for slitting the dna stains
13381	5	a lot of protein builds up in your body and you can produce a lot of muscle when you work out
13382	5	four major steps that are involved in protein synthesis are to get past all the parts in the cell membrane .
13383	5	anaphase interphase metaphase prophase
13384	5	the mrna sends a message to the rrna who get the rrna and tell the rrna what to do then the rrna passes the finishing process to the trna that fishes the process
13385	5	the mrna meet up wit the rrna and connect the protein together . they keep connecting these bonds until they get to a stopping bond .
13386	5	photosynthesis cell diffusion
13387	5	they help make sugar . they make copies . they are important to us
13388	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus . the mrna then goes to the dna . they copy the dna to make more of heathen they send the dna off to the cell .
13389	5	once the mrna leaves the nucleus it gets matched up with its pair . once they have both strands they treat codons . codons are involved in protein synthesis .
13390	5	you need it to live
13391	5	mrna is sent to a ribosome where there it is made into trna . the trna the goes to the codons where it is split into triplets where it can be read to be made into amino acids . the amino acids then can know what cells to make and what they do .
13392	5	the mrna is going to send the message of the codon then the trna will take place and that will translate the rna into an amino acid . finally then the amino acid is made .
13393	5	trna granary ac rna
13394	5	protein synthesis happens when the protein is produced stacked packaged and shipped throughout the cell
13395	5	the mrna attached then it says to stay or leave it then it goes back to the nucleus
13396	5	the mrna carries instructions from the nucleolus for the amino acid sequence of a protein .
13397	5	. directions are the then transferred by trna . attach to bonds . .

13404	5	first the mrna must travel to the ribosome and deliver the instructions . second the ribosome continues in creating the proteins . third the proteins travel down the er as it continues to be prepared fourth the proteins are packaged and released from the er .
13405	5	eating breathing sleeping walking
13406	5	osmosis diffusion transport and meiosis
13407	5	mrna leaves the nucleus and attached to a ribosome then the ribosome sends a message to the dna after that the mrna and the dna meet and exchanges amino acid sequences which makes trna which is taken to the protein .
13408	5	the mrna is received by the mitochondria where it s made and then it is sent to the other organelles that package and send it out to where it needs to go
13409	5	the first one would be that it enters . then it starts forming and growing . then it starts to bond with other things and form bigger than what it is already . then it starts doing what it was sent to do and takes action .
13410	5	go through the cell membrane to the ribosome then to the nucleus
13411	5	mrna leaves the nucleus giving message to ribosomes . ribosomes produce proteins . trna transfers the proteins . mrna returns to the nucleus .
13412	5	when the mrna leave the body it goes to the trna so it can transfer stuff to the ribosomes so it can make protein .
13413	5	. mrna leaves the nucleus . then rrna leaves . then mrna comes back . then rrna comes back
13414	5	mutation evolution
13415	5	rna protein synthesis
13416	5	mrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein . the amino acids line up the ribosomes .
13417	5	going to be read off and coped read as a blue print and formed and created an strong of protein
13418	5	leaves the nucleus then moves around the body .
13419	5	mrna leaves the nucleus and separates . new bases match up with the separated bases also known as translation . the new strand of trna codes for a protein which results in a protein chain forming with one protein for every three bases until the chain is coded to stop .
13420	5	mrna is translated to trna then the ribosomes make the protein .
13421	5	once mrna leaves the protein synthesis can begin
13422	5	the four steps in protein synthesis are when they begin to be made then specialized moved off then the protein perform certain jobs .
13423	5	it goes to the trna and lists the thing . trna takes it and develops it into an another strand .
13424	5	when mrna leaves . something else has to come in and replace it . . it has to make new ones . . it has to fight harder because of the missing mrna . they can build a new structure .
13425	5	the mrna attached to a ribosome or rrna . then the first anticodon or trna matches up with the start codon . then an amino acid attached to the trna . this process repeats itself until there are three amino acids linked together to form a protein .
13426	5	dna is the one thing you need in this . rna is another one you could use all the time . met could be one to use to help with one that can t do it . tm is the one they use a lot and they help with it all .
13427	5	trna rrna
13428	5	. the mrna will leave the nucleus . . then it will carry the gene sequence of the amino acid to the protein . . it will attach itself to the protein and exchange information with it . . the dna and rna information and sequences will then be exchanged .
13429	5	anaphase telophase prophase metaphase
13430	5	interphase prophase metaphase anaphase

13435	5	trna transfers proteins rrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein rrna
13436	5	rna copies itself twice then is broken down and then leaves the cell
13437	5	it stay in it just cant be seen by the human eye
13438	5	rna transfers to the mrna to feed off for the rna .
13439	5	separate find new rna combine with another mrna create trna
13440	5	the mrna is transcribed and is then sent as trna to codons to make amino acids which in result make protein .
13441	5	prophase metaphase anaphase metaphase
13442	5	. mrna attached to trna . . trna attached to rrna . . rrna attached to rrna . . rrna attached to the new strand of dna and transfers the information needed to create more dna .
13443	5	. everything must be healthy
13444	5	the rna breaks apart by the sugar then mrna comes in and tells what the strand is which makes the opposite strand to match up with its opposite and soon zips back up .
13445	5	. the mrna starts the process and eventually goes to trna . it goes to the second step . it is almost done it is now trna
13446	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus . the first step is that it enters the cell membrane then to the cell wall and then back to the nucleus .
13447	5	after leaving the nucleus the mrna it connects to a ribosome then the ribosome reads the dna and sends it to a rna strand and then it is sent into the cell membrane .
13448	5	the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are mrna which is messenger rna trna which is transfer rna and then rrna chichis ribosomal rna . mrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein . transfer rna transfers the proteins to the mitochondria . ribosomal rna has to do with ribosomes .
13449	5	mrna trna rrna rrna
13450	5	during protein synthesis an mrna molecule binds with a trna molecule that way it can be transported . after this it will go to the endoplasmic reticulum where protein synthesis takes place . here it will be encoded by nucleotides then it will be arranged the way it is supposed to be arranged and put back together .
13451	5	transcription happens which means the mrna copies the dna codes . translation happens at the ribosomes which makes the protein . the rrna makes the ribosomes .
13452	5	anaphase interphase metaphase and prophase . these phases are major steps in protein synthesis .
13453	5	the internal structure of the mitochondria serves to maximize cellular reproduction .
13454	5	they send the information to the dna the genes and traits are converted to the information the cell can use
13455	5	after the mrna leaves the nucleus the steps in protein synthesis are . anaphase . metaphase . telophase
13456	5	trna takes a segment of the sequence to the rna . rna makes the first strand of the dna . a complimentary strand is made . it reaches the stop codon .
13457	5	. mrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein . . the amino acids receive the instructions from the mrna and begin to form polypeptide chains . . the polypeptide chains form in the coded form of amino acids given from the mrna . . proteins are formed from the polypeptide sequences .
13458	5	. mrna leaves the nucleus . makes a new mrna . divides . mutation occurs
13459	5	mrna leaving first makes a copy of the dna and the rna
13460	5	the mrna enters the ribosome the ribosome reads the codons trna brings amino acids to the ribosome forms chain of amino acids .
13461	5	new codons attaching to the dna strand .
13462	5	protein synthesis is part of your body system something you have too have too keep you from getting sick all the time .
13463	5	unzipping and unwinding the dna transfer ring over to the cytoplasm of the cell . attaching to an amino acid . moving through the cell
13464	5	after it leaves the cell it then apaches to a dna strand . then a protein strand apaches to it giving it protein . after this the mrna relapses from the dna then it is a protein strand and it is used in other parts of the body .
13465	5	leaving the nucleus stopping to get some pro tines to ping at the mit second ra the ending out side the cell
13466	5	four major steps involved in protein synthesis are amino acids phosphate groups nitrogenous bases and sugars .
13467	5	make the protein multiply divide transfer the protein
13468	5	the mrna connects to the rna after that the protein begins to form from the mrna .
13469	5	its the essaying system it takes out what needs to be out . it gathers information that you might need . then it goes to rrna which is where the ribosomes make the protein then trna which then is where you transfer all of it in the body .
13470	5	the dna strand separates in . then it is known as rna . next the strand of dna is copied as the original strand of dna and the rna is copied to make protein .
13471	5	photosynthesis takes in sun and converts it into energy
13472	5	metamorphic anaphase telophase prophase
13473	5	it leaves goes to the trna which the trna transfers it which it then sends it to the rrna which decodes it
13474	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus and goes into the cytoplasm . there the trna has ribosomes attach to it . the trna then goes into the mitochondria where rrna makes proteins that the cell needs .
13475	5	the mrna goes to the ribosomes which make the proteins and then the ribosomes make the certain type of protein needed .
13476	5	transfer message rrna rrna
13477	5	first the mrna moves leaves the nucleus and changes into a trna then the trna attached a amino acid to its self . from there the trna lines up its sequences with the unzipped dna . leaving behind its amino acid they start to create a strand of amino acids known as a protein .
13478	5	the mrna carries the information to the amino acids . the information in the mrna helps build the proteins and structures . the amino acids and codons help make new cells and proteins . the
13479	5	rrna must replicate the rna sequence . the mrna must deliver the sequence to the dna . the trna transfers the protein to the dna sequence . the rrna is the final step .
13480	5	after the mrna leaves the nucleus the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are going to the golgi apparatus dropping off protein which then goes to the lysosomes next being dropped off on mitochondria and last being received by the cell .
13481	5	. transferring to the ribosomes . . the ribosomes making the proteins . . trna moving protein throughout the cell . . starts back at the nucleus .
13482	5	one step would be cell diffusion when a cell connected to another form a hydrogen bond . the second step would be when the mrna fuses the two cells together . the third step is when the hydrogen bonds leaves . the forth step is when the mrna leaves that cell and moves down the line to the next cell .
13483	5	an enzyme breaks apart a strand of rna an enzymes goes through reading and matching them with the correct match creating a codon the codon is read and produces an amino acid the amino acids attach and great a protein chain
13484	5	the mrna sends the protein to the trna encrypt the codon release the codon and the codon goes to the nucleolus
13485	5	prophase metaphase anaphase prophase through out these processes they slept an make a new cell .
13486	5	goes to make protein .
13487	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus then i goes to another cell and it kind of sends a message to the cell and it makes it own copy of what the mrna brought over
13488	5	messenger rna leaves the nucleus and carries amino acids to transfer rather trna hooks on to the amino acids and puts them in pairs of three to form protein . rna polymer as goes down the rows of proteins and checks for errors . the proteins are then coded from rna to dna and bonded together by hydrogen bonds .
13489	5	the first major step would be to take the mrna to trna so the trna can translate the dna s strands . from there the trna will go to the rrna . third it will pass the information to the mrna . then finally the rna will be finished and a new strand will be made .
13490	5	proteins provide energy for the cell so it can do all of its duties .
13491	5	the mrna meets up with the dna and connects with the codons .
13492	5	the trna as translated then it is transferred finds the match and brings it back
13493	5	it helps the body fight viruses . it also helps the body wit you red blood cells . keeps the body energized . and helps the body strength .
13494	5	the mrna leaves then it try to go to where it needs to go once it gets to the place it send the information to the brain and then the brain tells the body what to do .
13495	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus then it transforms into trna . it changes so that the trna can move from inside the cell to the outside . the trna then splits in half to create two half strands of dna . the half strands then pick up stray amino acids that match up with the corresponding amino on the dna . a matches with u and c matches with g .
13496	5	the mrna or messenger rna is sent out through a nuclear pore in the nucleus . it then travels around in the cytoplasm and settles somewhere within it . it then sits around and waits and then when a ribosome comes around it hooks itself on to the mrna . the mrna then sends instructions to the ribosome and together they start making proteins in protein synthesis .
13497	5	. the mrna goes out of the nucleus . the mrna splits in two . the two strands create a matching side for itself . the mrna create organs in the body the end .

13500	5	ink . . . . . like leaving
13501	5	when the trna lives the rna to go to the dna
13502	5	the four major steps are when it enter the cell it goes threw the process it began it help the nucleus and then it is synthesis .
13503	5	. trna attached to mrna . . codons attach with anticodons . . a polypeptide chain forms . . proteins are created .
13504	5	four major steps involved in protein synthesis are after mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to the ribosomes telling the ribosomes the different proteins in the nucleus . then the mrna is beginning to copy itself . after that you have two forms of mrna that now contain proteins . proteins are made in the ribosomes and lastly you have your proteins that become attached the rough endoplasmic reticulum .
13505	5	it starts with rna and leads to protein synthesis .
13506	5	. the mrna leaves the nucleus after crying the dna code . the mrna takes the code to the ribosome . . in the ribosome the trna transfers the code into codons . . then matches are found for the codon and put together starting with a start codon and ending in a atp codon to result in a protein .
13507	5	four things that involve in protein synthetics is carbon dioxide hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen . also sometimes suffer .
13508	5	mrna is in the nucleus mrna writes a message trna takes it to the cell membrane rrna decodes the message
13509	5	there r steps
13510	5	mrna meiosis
13511	5	transcription translation messenger rna and respiration . transcription copies what needs to be copied . translation removes what needs to be removed . messenger rna sends what message needs to be sent . respiration helps clear out any germs .
13512	5	. mrna leaves the nucleus . it teams up with other cells . the cells carry out there jobs . they form there protein
13513	5	it receives sends takes back and gives off .
13514	5	the mrna travels to a ribosome . the trna attached to the mrna and matches up bases in a process known as translation . then the trna brings these codes and matches them with amino acids . these amino acids are then put together and form a protein .
13515	5	. the two singled stranded dna s are cut in half . . one of the single stranded dna s would exit the nucleus . . the mrna would connect with a peptide bond . . the mrna that is connected by a peptide bond would connect with more to treat a protein .
13516	5	sends a message
13517	5	trna enters comes and attached itself to the mrna and creates amino acids to give to the rrna to give to the ribosomes which then makes into protein that get transported to the golgi apprentice that synthesizes the protein .
13518	5	mrna leaves the nucleus . then goes through to transfer its mrna with trna then it turns into a trait then transfer the rna through the protein .
13519	5	interphase anaphase metaphase prophase
13520	5	getting nutrients drinking milk
13521	5	after mrna leaves the nucleus it then attacks to the dna then the dna unzips then the protein detaches and then you have protein synthesis .
13522	5	mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to trna and trna sends whatever message mrna gives it to a cell in the body . this is how mrna gets messages to other parts of the body .
13523	5	. anaphase . interphase . metaphase . prophase
13524	5	protein synthesis has major steps involved . the first one is the mrna leaving the nucleus . mrna is considered the messenger . mrna carries instructions for the amino acid sequence that is shown in a protein . once the information gets to where it is needed the cell uses it to make a protein .
13525	5	mrna goes out into the cytoplasm and into the ribosomes to the nucleus to the nucleolus
13526	5	the mrna matches up with the rna and creates proteins .
13527	5	the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are traveling to the nucleolus ribosomes are developed the mrna travels to the nucleolus to give it instructions to make a ribosome .
13528	5	mrna send a massage to the nucleus saying that it is time to divide . rrna trna transfers the dna to the new cell .
13529	5	as the mrna leaves through the pores of the nucleus it travels to the ribosomes or amino acids . at the ribosomes the mrna puts the protein and information . after the ribosomes or amino acids have that the information is evenly distributed and the cell begins to split . the cell then is pinched in the middle to make two new cells .
13530	5	mrna leaves the nucleus . trna transports . rrna produces ribosomes .
13531	5	. help your muscles . keeps you from german sick
13532	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus and becomes a trna and then it travels across the body
13533	5	prophase metaphase telophase and anaphase
13534	5	the nucleus sends out orders to make out proteins . the mrna carries those orders and instructions for the proteins . then the mitochondria makes the proteins and then the proteins are transported other parts of the body where they are needed .
13535	5	mrna leaves the nucleus goes to the lysosomes gives them the code assembles the protein and trna takes it away
13536	5	then its the rna proteins amino acid and sugar .
13537	5	once the mrna leaves the nucleus the cell divides it has the same dna the cell grows and matures and then divides doing the process over again .
13538	5	after mrna leaves the nucleus
13539	5	the m rna travels along the rough er and then travels to the golgi apparatus and gets shaped off from there .
13540	5	mrna takes the code for the amino acid to the ribosome . this is where the construction of the protein occurs . rrna copies one strand from the original and trna takes the new material to the nucleus where it matches up according to the new code that it has formed . this new rna has both an original copied strand from the first code and a new strand as well .
13541	5	it leaves the nucleus then goes to the nucleus the nucleotide and then it goes to membranes
13542	5	anti codons match up with codons then ribosomes are made and then proteins are made .
13543	5	the four major steps involved in protein synthesis is growing drinking water and patting right .
13544	5	one mrna enters the cell . two mrna moves around in the cell . three mrna enter the nucleus . four mrna leaves the cell .
13545	5	mimi sos
13546	5	protein photosynthesis starts by leaving the nucleus . after it leaves the nucleus it gets transported to the cell wall membrane to be flushed out of the system . once that has been done the mrna goes through the body to help the body contribute to certain . . things the next major step is that it completes the cycle only to start over again as another mrna leaving the nucleus .
13547	5	it begins to go through translations to change and then heads to transcriptions then moves immediately to certain parts of the body .
13548	5	the sequence leaves the nucleus as mrna . then the message gets changed into trna . then the sequence moves to the mitochondria as trna . then the message gets decoded so that the body can understand it .
13549	5	the four major steps are interphase metaphase prophase and anaphase .
13550	5	when mrna leaves the nucleus it rapidly changes and goes through phases and then protein synthesis is produced .
13551	5	there are four major steps to protein synthesis . first mrna leaves the nucleus with information and takes it to the cytoplasm . from there the information is broken into strands of amino acids . then it is taken to the mitochondria where energy is taken and then it is taken back to the nucleus . then the proteins are made . these four steps are a major part in protein synthesis .
13552	5	four major steps in protein synthesis when mrna leaves the nucleus is when the mrna goes through the protein and the endoplasmic reticulum
13553	5	when mrna leaves the nucleus it sends the information to trna trna then transcribes the mrna codon sequence to a specific location that will then be used to start protein synthesis once it is complete it is taken away and used up .
13554	5	expansion radiation growth divide
13555	5	the four major steps in protein synthesis is reproduction movement meiosis and mitosis .
13556	5	. sends the info to be coded . . translation sends info to the trna . transcription translates the info . transpiration transportation of info
13557	5	after the mrna leaves the nucleus the trna comes in and transfers the rna to the golgi apparatus and then the receptor proteins come in and produce proteins and then the dna strand comes in and the dna replicates making protein synthesis .
13558	5	mrna leaving the nucleus mrna leaving the cell mrna traveling to the brain mrna delivering the message to the brain
13559	5	once the mrna leaves it starts its trip to take what ever message it has to the nucleolus . then after that the nucleolus receives the message . next the mrna returns to its original place . last it starts all over again .

13566	5	for major steps involving protein synthesis are translocation transition metaphase and meiosis .
13567	5	first it leaves second it copy to trna
13568	5	collecting the energy using the energy getting rid of the used up energy get more energy .
13569	5	after the mrna leaves the nucleus the next rna leave as filled trna rrna and then rrna .
13570	5	. the mrna reads the three letters . it makes sure that they are the right letters . it puts the three letters together with the other three letters . it puts it where it needs to go
13571	5	. mrna . trna . dna . rna
13572	5	once the mrna leaves the nucleus it then travels to a ribosome . at the ribosome trna brings matching codon along with the corresponding protein to be attached by the rrna . after the protein sequence is complete the newly formed gene and protein sequence travel through the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus until it reaches the protein channel . the protein channel will then open and allow the sequence to travel to the correct part of the body .
13573	5	the four major steps involved in protein synthesis include . mrna traveling by use of the endoplasmic reticulum . dna unzips . the new protein is inserted into the section of dna selected . the dna is then put back together
13574	5	first the mrna which is messenger rna that will leave the nucleus . then from there it will travel to find trna which is transfer rna . after the mrna finds the trna it will then travel to the ribosomes . and that is where protein synthesis occurs . and then the process will occur over and over .
13575	5	sugar phosphate protein ribosomal nucleic acid
13576	5	mrna sends it to trna
13577	5	the mrna goes into the cytoplasm to trna and gives him the codons . the the trna uses that code of dna to match it up to its code . then peptide bonds and added to keep them together .
13578	5	. native system . . digestive system . .
13579	5	its the same as dna .
13580	5	it goes to the ribosomes to be made
13581	5	the mrna makes a copy of itself called trna . the trna goes to the ribosome where the ribosome attached to the trna strand . the ribosome begins to decode the trna into codons and makes a protein for every codon . the ribosome continues until it comes across a stop codon in which it releases the trna strand .
13582	5	carries the information to the mitochondrion . the mitochondrion does its job then eventually makes the protein .
13583	5	genes have protein and lose them protein leaves the body protein dies organisms dies
13584	5	the mrna transports the message to the trna . the trna then brings the amino acids to the ribosome rrna . the ribosome makes the protein .
13585	5	makes trna translation replication transcription
13586	5	the s phase the g phase the m phase the g phase .
13587	5	it travels out of the cell and trough the membrane . it then goes and try to find a lysosome cell . it enters the lysosome cell . then the lysosome cell decodes the mrna .
13588	5	it gets transferred and then more is made and sent throughout the needed areas .
13589	5	mrna leaves the nucleus then it goes to the membrane through the cell wall and out of the cell .
13590	5	carrying the rna . making new mrna . making new dna . translating mrna
13591	5	the four main steps involved in protein synthesis is dna to mrna which is called transcription . then mrna to trna is translation . then the amino acids into codons .
13592	5	after it leaves then it goes through transcription . then rna is produced then it goes through translation then turns into amino acids
13593	5	. the mrna goes to the ribosome to get the protein . brings the protein back to nucleus . the protein is coded for in dna . protein sent back to lysosome
13594	5	trna mrna dna dna they are all those types
13595	5	. the mrna leaves the nucleus and travels to a ribosome . . the translation finds the other half of the strand . . the amino acids are found for the dna until the stop codon is found . . the mrna carries to proteins back to the nucleus .
13596	5	trna transfers data rrna receives the data
13597	5	. rrna selected . trna carries . rrna copied . dna result
13598	5	step the mrna will take the out of the nucleolus and start through the cytoplasm step it will be taken and copied and or the part that is needed step the new dna will be put inside the cell needing the information step the new cell will use the dna
13599	5	fixes the lesseps the other rna s create cleans up verses puts the proteins in the right order fixes all imperfections .
13600	5	the mrna goes to the ribosomes . the mrna is copied by proteins . the proteins drop off codons in the order of the rna . the new strand is put with another strand to make dna .
13601	5	the mrna must go find the ribosomes then find the helper t cells then they go and find the b cells and have a helper protein through synthesis .
13602	5	the mrna first gets in the cytoplasm so it can move throughout the cell . then it gets into the proteins . after that it parts to make copies of the proteins . finally it copies the proteins fully so there are more proteins within the cells .
13603	5	it will change from mrna to rna or dna or even trna
13604	5	it is ripped apart copied and put back together
13605	5	rna must meet with a similar type of dna . the dna and rna match up and form an amino acid . the amino acids chain up creating an amino chain . then you find the codon .
13606	5	. mrna go to the cytoplasm where it combines with rrna . . then it goes to the ribosomes where transcription occurs . . after transcription occurs translation occurs to form trna . . once the trna is formed it makes an amino acid which helps make the protein .
13607	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus to deliver the information to the rrna .
13608	5	mrna is the messenger rna . it sends messages throughout the cells to keep energy going .
13609	5	codons start to for together then the attach to one another finally they create a new strand of dna
13610	5	. mitosis . meiosis . crossing over . degradation
13611	5	it goes through all of the stages then it breaks down and then it synthesizes it .
13612	5	the protein enters the body and then spread through it then eventually it is digested
13613	5	protein synthesis is when the protein gets enough energy .

13625	5	the ribosome leaves the cell and goes into another cell
13626	5	mrna comes into contact with dna then the mrna starts to unwind then the mrna starts to rap around then finally the mrna has rapped around the dna
13627	5	the mrna leaves the cells divide the cells make two separate cells .
13628	5	. protein enters the cell . protein moves throughout the cell to the nucleus . protein feeds the nucleus . the nucleus has new energy to control the cell
13629	5	protein helps protect from viruses carries instructions for the amino acid sequence
13630	5	the mrna is passed . then trna transports it . after that is rrna .
13631	5	the mrna is the messenger rna which goes tells the the cell how to make the proteins . then the protein are put together by matching up amino acids . this is when a mutation could occur . next they are stranded together to make the protein and the proteins are shaped together by ribosomes .
13632	5	mrna remembers what this cell looks like of does . rrna then has the instructions for it rrna has the genetics for it trna transmits the stuff
13633	5	it starts off with mrna then rrna and trna
13634	5	protein synthesis starts with the mrna to get rid of the extra protein in the body it helps to break it up and go through the digestive system .
13635	5	breaks off finds new strand connects transcribes
13636	5	the first step is the mrna carries information to all cells . the second step transmits the information . the third step studies the information and the last step puts the information into act .
13637	5	mrna leaves the nucleus after transcription and goes out to attach to transport rna . the transport rna attached to the codons that match the mrna codon . the transport rna takes the codons to another cell that makes proteins . then the cell goes through translation and decodes the codons sent form the transport rna to make protein .

13645	5	mrna delivers messages to the rna to change it into dna and then it delivers the codes .
13646	5	mrna creates the protein using amino acids the protein are then assembled into groups when the proteins are gathered into groups they then organize themselves into the sequence they were given then dna is formed .
13647	5	proteins in amino acids are made and distributed amino acids are made phosphate groups form and other sugars are made .
13648	5	mrna then carries instructions that help protein synthesis .
13649	5	four major steps that have to occur are mrna has to sent the rna trna have to transfer the rna rrna and rrna . the amino acids must be transcribed and translated .
13650	5	mrna brings amino acids to the nucleus
13651	5	mrna trna rrna

13653	5	prophase metaphase anaphase and interphase are involved in protein synthesis . they all work together to make new cells for the messenger rna to carry to the nucleus .
13654	5	transcription translation amino aides are made . then the amino acids make proteins .
13655	5	. the mrna attached to an amino acid . the mrna then finds a trna . the trna then transfers the amino acid . the amino acid becomes a protein
13656	5	they copy
13657	5	first you have to find the protein in the mrna . then you create the nucleotide transfer the rna create the rna
13658	5	the rna leaves the nucleus . the proteins begin to separate . the proteins are finished separating . the proteins begin to synthesize .
13659	5	the first step is metaphase which is the cell developing . the second is interphase which is when the cell slowly starts to come together . the third is prophase where the cells split . the last phase is the restart of metaphase .
13660	5	mrna leaves the nucleus and is then transported into trna . from there it will be transcribed into rrna . then rrna will be transformed into proteins .
13661	5	. mrna leaves the nucleus . trna form over the strand of mrna and get the protein signature . . the trna recover the needed molecules to create the protein and leave . the molecules left by the trna bind to the mrna to create a protein . . the mrna is destroyed
13662	5	the mrna is outside of the nucleus which then becomes trna and goes into the ribosomes which then produce the amino acids and makes dna .
13663	5	trna to rrna to rrna
13664	5	mrna leaves the nucleus and takes the messages or codes to the other rna s .
13665	5	the mrna enters the ribosome . the ribosome then developed instruction to make proteins . the proteins are then entered into the cells . once they are entered into the cells they get instructions for the genetic material .
13666	5	mrna leaves nucleus caring the dna deoxyr ibo nucleic acid using the atp which helps boost the energy . the rna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence . rna rico nucleic acid . now it makes the proteins and is carried with the atp . the dna has the blueprint and information .
13667	5	mitosis meiosis s phase anaphase
13668	5	cleans reproduces does its job helps the body out .
13669	5	protein synthesis is when the mrna takes the information and then transfers it throughout the cell . the steps begin with prophase when the cell begins . then the cells begin to separate and come together in the middle . then the one cell begins to split and become two different cells .
13670	5	it matches up with a similar mrna then is copies over then is divides then it stars over
13671	5	the four major steps are getting protein sugars and telling the cell what to do
13672	5	mrna attached to a ribosome the the mrna combines with trna which forms amino acids then the amino acid forms a protein .
13673	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to a trna the t rna copies the information to find the amino acid and gives back to the mrna . the mrna goes back to the nucleus . the mrna gives the information to the nucleus .
13674	5	trna endoplasmic rrna

13676	5	trna rrna rrna rna
13677	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus . the dna is copied . the dna creates new dna . the dna dies
13678	5	dna is transcribed trna . the information in the dna is used to build a protein . messenger mrna tells the ribosome how the protein is to be made . the protein has peptide bonds to link it together .
13679	5	first mrna leaves the nucleus second the mrna floating in the cytoplasm third it creates the coding zipper of genes making the amino acids fourth then it comes all together to turn into the proteins
13680	5	mrna travels to the edge of the cell where the trna picks it up . the trna codes for the right amino acid . these then combine to form a protein .
13681	5	anaphase prophase metaphase and analyzing
13682	5	th first step is going to the trna and getting pushed to the golgi apparatus . then it goes to the the place for the protein to be made . then it goes to the plasma membrane .
13683	5	mrna leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome . giving the message to the ribosomes to start making proteins . the proteins are made and sent out of do their jobs .
13684	5	it codes it . it breaks it down . it decodes it . it sends it back
13685	5	. first protein is coded . then it is translated . then transcribed . and finally it is turned into a protein
13686	5	metaphase telophase anaphase interphase
13687	5	the four steps in protein synthesis starting after the mrna leaves the nucleus are as followed . the first step is that ribosomes are transformed . the second step is that they are made into antibodies .
13688	5	translation transformation then the mrna take the information to the mitochondria were the proteins are made .
13689	5	leaving cutting putting it back together and joining back to one another .
13690	5	mrna leaving the membrane trade to the mitochondria then the trna goes to the nucleus and does the transferring
13691	5	. it grows . it splits . it splits the body in two . you know have two
13692	5	after the mrna leaves the nucleus the trna enters . this will be used in the later steps the second step is where the trna moves to another spot in the nucleus . there it begins to make complementary strands . in the third step the complementary strands are made and connected with the original strand . the rrna also enters and receives important information . lastly the trna leaves the nucleus and the mrna reenters starting the process over .
13693	5	it is cut up into smaller strands then split in two then prepared
13694	5	protein synthesis consists of sunlight co and oxygen .
13695	5	one of the major steps for the mrna is to gather the genetic information and bring it back to the nucleus .
13696	5	sending a message to the nucleus
13697	5	the three major steps involved in protein synthesis are trna rrna and rrna .
13698	5	anaphase which is when the protein begins the process of meiosis . interphase which is when the protein begins to divide into the two daughter cells . metaphase which is when the protein does its crossing over . prophase which is the last phase of meiosis .
13699	5	goes through the cytoplasm to the ribosomes then it matches up with the trna which that goes to the nucleolus .
13700	5	the first step in the mrna leaving the nucleus . the second step in the mrna binding to a protein the third is the protein attaching to another protein . the fourth is the two proteins binding together .
13701	5	next is trna which goes to the membrane then the rrna goes to the ribosomes after that the ribosomes break down and decompose
13702	5	protein is distributed through out the body
13703	5	mrna rrna trna and rrna
13704	5	first the mrna goes to the ribosome . then the ribosome makes the proteins . which then are made into amino acids . then they are put into a dna strand to make new dna .
13705	5	cell communication the small opening for the two cells to communicate
13706	5	mrna leaves the nucleus and is transcribed into a protein . it is then coded into amino acids and turned into a polypeptide chain .
13707	5	the mrna finds and attached to a ribosome . free floating trna with an amino acid come and attach to the codon on the mrna that matches with its own anticodon . the amino acid disconnects from the trna and attached to the ribosome . once that is finished the trna disconnects and another floating trna attached to the mrna . the amino acids bind together by peptide bonds and the protein is formed when the last trna disconnects from the mrna codon .
13708	5	mrna leaves the nucleus it tells the cell what to do
13709	5	once mrna leaves the nucleus mrna travels to the ribosome . then translation begins so the other half of the strand will be found . then mrna tells trna to gout and find the amino acids . then amino acids are found for the strand of dna until the stop codon is found .
13710	5	after the mrna leaves the nucleus it carries information to the nucleus . the nucleus puts that information into a dna sequence made up of amino acids . it then makes a copy of it and it is transferred into another dna sequence where the codons can be read .
13711	5	mrna leaves the nucleus then enters the er drops off the genetic info then the er create protein .
13712	5	. the mrna gets the message . . mrna travels through body to necessary place . . gives or receives the message sent for . . returns to the nucleus
13713	5	make you stronger
13714	5	the first step is it goes to the ribosome and they pair up with their matches and then the hydrogen bonds put in order what goes where
13715	5	the mrna enters the mitochondria . then it gets synthesis ed . proteins come in and match the mrna . at the end the proteins are synthesis ed and the mrna is copied .
13716	5	leave start to create protein develop te protein pass on
13717	5	mrna makes protein
13718	5	the trna attached itself to three codons with its anticodons . then another trna comes and does the same . the airings make a strand of amino acids .
13719	5	goes to the mitochondria . . . . . .
13720	5	mrna transfers to trna after that codons are created they release nucleotides the nucleotides help to create the protein
13721	5	mrna leaving the nucleus mrna reaching the brain mrna reaching the golgi apparatus golgi apparatus making protein
13722	5	mrna goes to the ribosomes .
13723	5	translation trance version
13724	5	. as the mrna leaves the nucleus it connects with another strand of rna . . ribosomes are made . . ribosomes go through a process . . they give out protein .
13725	5	step when the mrna leaves the nucleus it flows to another organism step when the mrna is in the nucleus it will start to work
13726	5	transporting replication translation transcription
13727	5	when the mrna leaves the nucleus it then enters the cytoplasm her it goes to the ribosomes . then codons send a signal to the trna and that attached to the codons on the ribosome . when all the amino acids line up it is called a peptide chain .
13728	5	it carries messages to other cells . the messages are carried back . then the cell uses the information to do stuff . then the cycle restarts .
13729	5	protein is created protein is used protein leaves more protein is made
13730	5	the four major parts in protein synthesis are trna rrna mrna and . trna takes a copy of the genetic strand and gives it to the mrna . the mrna takes the copy of the genetic strand and carries it out of the nucleus . then the rrna makes a new copy of the genetic strand . mrna messenger rna trna transfer rna rrna ribosomal rna
13731	5	cell mutation cell translation cell transformation cell reproduction
13732	5	first they come into the body then they attack and destroy before there destroyed but before that they take out the red cells first
13733	5	trna
13734	5	they have to get energy from the sun . they have to turn that into carbon dioxide . they store the protein in a vacuole .
13735	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus to go to the ribosomes where it is attached to a trna molecule which has amino acids and anti codons . the protein synthesis then starts with the aug codon and begins to use the amino acids to form peptide bonds . the trna breaks off when it no longer has amino acids and a new trna takes it spot . the protein synthesis will continue making peptide bonds until a stop codon is reached . the peptide bonds then break off forming a protein .
13736	5	trna helps the body fight off the disease the organism then is killed by other helping areas of the body . rrna carries instructions from the nucleus rrna mrna
13737	5	starting with mrna leaving the nucleus four other major steps involved in protein synthesis are the nucleus tells the cell what needs to be done the mrna finds a ribosome to help make the protein the ribosome starts the process of protein synthesis the protein is made .
13738	5	eating running lifting drinking liquids
13739	5	mrna leaves the nucleus . mrna then attacks to some dna . mrna then is able to move the dna . mrna moves the dna to a membrane and attacks to it .
13740	5	messenger rna leaves the nucleus to start off . then the body antibiotics begin to produce proteins . in which they help heal and keep the body and the immune system healthy .
13741	5	mrna or messenger rna leaves the cell and goes to the ribosomes to tell them what to make so the dna can replicate itself . then the rrna or ribosomal rna tells the ribosomes what protein to make to produce the power dna needed for replication . then trna or transfer rna transfers the copied dna back to the strands of original dna to be fused to gather and produce new dna
13742	5	new nucleus
13743	5	first the mrna leaves the membrane and enters the cytoplasm . next it binds to a ribosome or rrna . transport or trna picks up amino acids and brings them to the ribosome . finally the ribosome with the help of the trna binds the amino acids together in the order specified by the mrna .
13744	5	the mrna must go to the trna to be transferred . the mrna must travel through the nucleus . then the mrna must go to the mitochondrion . the mrna must then transfer its data to the trna to be processed .
13745	5	mrna goes to a gene strand and then takes a codon from there . after trna takes the codon and brings it into a sequence of dna . then the codon
13746	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to the mitochondria with the right materials needed . then the mitochondria incomes all that information and singles a transfer rna . that transfer rna then goes and locates all the right amino acids to makes that protein . then all the amino acids are brought back to the mitochondria and the mitochondria forms or creates that protein .
13747	5	replication
13748	5	sun sun sun sun
13749	5	mrna leaves the nucleus with the coded instructions . then the mrna visits various proteins making the coded instructions more specific and longer . soon after that the mrna meets up with a trna . finally the trna assists the mrna by helping the mrna give the coded instructions to the rrna .

13763	5	rrna constructs the ribosome mrna feeds into the ribosome trna reads the mrna trna gets the complementary proteins to create the chain
13764	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus . then the mrna takes the codes for making proteins into another cell . the cell reads the code and begins translating what it says to make the amino acid that needs to be produced . the trna containing codons bring down each instruction . the cell begins to make the protein and produces what the body needs .
13765	5	mrna leaves the nucleus and attached to a ribosome . that ribosome then becomes rrna . the rrna scans the section of dna and remembers it . next the rrna gives the information to the trna . the trna then transfers the information in sections onto the dna strand .
13766	5	anaphase has all chromosomes metaphase they start to split telophase there are two cells prophase
13767	5	. two types of rna read the instructions for making that specific protein . . then amino acids are matched to the end on a rna polymer as .
13768	5	leaves the nucleus carries the message for the dna sequence to the ribosomes delivers the message goes back to get another message .
13769	5	trna transfers the dna and carries it to the cell membrane . dna copies the dna .
13770	5	first dna is replicated and is coded for the new sequence . in mrna the dna sequence is read and is coded into an mrna sequence . that step is called transcription . next the mrna sequence is coded for an amino acid sequence . that step is called translation . in translation trna is used to help code for the amino acids . once the trna is coded into an amino acid sequence protein synthesis is complete .
13771	5	after the mrna leaves the nucleus the mrna meets with the trna then the mrna tells the trna how to make the protein and finally the protein is made .

13776	5	nucleus is part of a cell .
13777	5	after the mrna leaves the nucleolus it travels to trna . this is where it delivers the message as to what kind of proteins to make . the trna decodes the message and starts to create peptide bonds . after multiple peptide bonds are formed you have a polypeptide bond . this is the beginning of protein synthesis .
13778	5	they are being synthesis ed
13779	5	mutation
13780	5	carries instructions from the nucleus to the amino acid to make a sequence .

13782	5	the first step is trna goes and gets the message from mrna . the second step is trna then goes to the breathe third step is that mrna gives it to the grate fourth and final step is rrna gives it to the brain which gives off synthesis
13783	5	when mrna leaves the nucleus the ribosomes start with protein synthesis . if you have more ribosomes the cell will have more protein .
13784	5	it goes out attar ches to the nail spends into two strands then it makes protein synthesis
13785	5	proteins are transferred from the nucleus with mrna . they then go to the rest of the body . they supply the body with energy . then they come back to the nucleus and start the process over again .
13786	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus and enters the ribosome .
13787	5	after mrna leaves the nucleus it will go into translation . this occurs when the chromosomes attach to the single stranded rna they have a certain amino acid then another chromosome comes and attached to the strand . that new strand has another amino acid in which they will attach together and form a peptide bond after that happens that bond will stay in the newer chromosome it will then slide down the strand until it reaches the stop codon . along the way more peptide bonds were formed which led to a long strand of amino acids . those will then transfer into proteins and brought into another part of the cell and become enzymes . this occurs in the ribosome .
13788	5	nucleolus acid proteins simple sugar . . .
13789	5	when the mrna leaves the nucleus it carries a code to make the protein . it gives the code to a complementary strand and they fit together . the rna starts making amino acids . finally the amino acids string together like a puzzle to form the protein .
13790	5	mitochondria and ribosomes . and nucleic acids
13791	5	when the mrna leaves the cell it is then read and changed into trna . that process is called transcription . then the trna is translated is into an amino acid sequence during translation . then an enzyme reads the codon and makes an anticodon . then the anticodon is formed into an amino acid .
13792	5	. mrna leaves the nucleus . . the mrna transfers information to the nucleotide . . nucleotide gathers all the information . . nucleotide pushes it all out of the cell .

13810	5	. takes the data to a transfer rna . decodes it . makes it into a protein . sends to where it needs to go
13811	5	. mrna does its job . mutations occur . then si sing begins . the process ends . s . rrna rrna and trna
13812	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus and then is met by the rrna to copy the message . after this is complete it then is transferred trna and then shipped to rrna for packing .
13813	5	the mrna recopies .
13814	5	the mrna goes to the ribosome where trna attached to the mrna strand . then the trna codons code the mrna . the protein attached to the trna bond together to make the protein as trna codes the mrna . each trna part falls out as another one attached and codes .
13815	5	absorb the protein your body needs . get rid of the waste . and send the protein .
13816	5	. a strand of mrna leaves the nucleus to find a ribosome . . the strand of mrna attached to a ribosome to wait to have a trna attach to it . . several trna with only three base pairs at the bottom and a single amino acid at the top attach the mrna codes that match up . . the trna leave after the next trna takes it s amino acid to produce an amino acid chain . eventually the mrna will have a stop codon and when the last trna attached to it the amino acid chain will be the protein .
13817	5	when it starts out the letters are coat and when it changes coat t changes to u .
13818	5	mrna will attach itself to a ribosome making rrna . the ribosome will send out trna attached to a amino acid and an anticodon . trna will match the anti codon with the codon from the original strand of dna . the amino acids will start to form a chain . during a polypeptide assembly line . when the stop codon gets matched with it s anticodon . the protein is formed .
13819	5	mitochondria gives cells protein
13820	5	after mrna leaves the nucleus it moves to the ribosome where translation occurs . this is when the anticodons attach to the codons . the anticodons are carrying an amino acid for each of the specific amino acid sequence . once the first amino acid attached another one attached connecting the amino acids together . then the first anticodon leaves the mrna codon and another attached taking the previous amino acid . after this is over the amino acids run into a stop codon amino an amino acid .
13821	5	. mrna leaves the nucleus containing all the information needed to make new dna . . the dna protein is unzipped by a form of rna . . the trna then transfers the existing strand of dna onto a new strand and is zipped back up . . the new strand is then coded for its proteins and is sent on its merry way .
13822	5	as the protein leaves the nucleus it goes to the rough endoplasmic reticulum which sorts it . it then it passed to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum which packages it . its then shipped to the golgi apparatus where it is the shipped out of the cell .
13823	5	trna is madeira contents to something
13824	5	first the mrna is taken to a nucleus . second it goes through a chain where it release energy at each level .
13825	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus through a nucleus pore . after the mrna leaves the nucleus the mrna finds the ribosome which is located in the cytoplasm . the mrna connects with the first codon on the ribosome . then the trna comes and connects with the first codon and the mrna is released into the cytoplasm . then the trna release the amino acid that is connected to the trna .
13826	5	mrna takes the dna from the nucleus and sends it around in the cell to be copied . then trna decodes the dna strand and makes more of it to the body so the body can easily pick the things it needs to copy . then the cell splits into two and makes one more strand to keep off to the side just in case something gets taken away from the cell .
13827	5	the four steps are
13828	5	mrna takes the codons from the nucleus . then it goes through transcription . then translation . trna makes the correct amino acid .
13829	5	mrna attach themselves to a the other half of a dna strand . they use reverse transcript as . next trna link together in chains of codons that code for an amino acid which is the building blocks of proteins . the trna then take these codes to be converted into amino acids .
13830	5	leaves the nucleus to get to the protein . makes copies of itself .
13831	5	receive settle in begging reproducing
13832	5	the rrna goes and tells the ribosome to make the protein so then the mrna attached to the ribosome then that attracts an amino acid and then the trna transports the amino acid to the ribosome and the process keeps going until the protein is complete .
13833	5	after mrna leaves the nucleus it then produces to the ribosomes which begin to leave the cell through the endoplasmic reticulum they are attached to . after they are through the endoplasmic reticulum they proceed to the golgi apparatus in order to then leave the cell .
13834	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus goes to the ribosome gets packaged golgi apparatus and exits the cell .

13847	5	firstly from the nucleus mrna is transported to the ribosome then the ribosome uses the mrna as a template for the protein then the protein is transported to the rough endoplasmic reticulum where it is stored .
13848	5	once the mrna leaves the nucleus it travels around the cytoplasm looking for a ribosome . once found the ribosome splits into two separate pieces one considerably larger than the other . these fragments then clamp onto the mrna and begin to decode the mrna sequence . each codon is matched with trna that is attached at the other end to an amino acid corresponding to the codon blueprint .
13849	5	. mrna carries out the instructions to proteins . proteins red elope in the mitochondria . mitochondria processes and increases protein . protein is released to provide energy

13908	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus . it is sent to the active site . the active site then copies the mrna sequence . the transporter rna takes the sequence out . last the protein sequence is laced together to form the protein .
13909	5	it unwinds the mrna . then it codes the mrna . then it zips it back up . then it goes outside of the cell .
13910	5	anaphase
13911	5	first in order the major steps involving protein synthesis is that the mrna leaves the nucleus and goes into the bloodstream next it goes straight into the liver also it goes and injects its genetic dna into the protein then last it goes back directly to the bloodstream .
13912	5	after the mrna leaves the nucleus it finds the gene sequence . when it finds the sequence it the attached . after the attachment if breaks off at certain parts . and then it becomes a ribosome and after it enters the membrane and becomes a protein .
13913	5	one of the steps is putting them into groups . second is using the proteins to make amino acids . the third to to turn the amino acids into strands of dna . the last step is to to have them bonded together .
13914	5	mrna leaves then dna comes
13915	5	the four steps involved in protein synthesis are translation transcription . . . translation is when carrier proteins are made . transcription is when transport proteins are made .
13916	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus to the ribosome to the trna . there trna transcribes it so that the cell knows what proteins to produce . then the protein is made .
13917	5	collecting the information . replicating it . they transporting it and soon using it .
13918	5	the protein synthesis helps make protein .
13919	5	. the mrna leaves the body . . unzips . repeats .

13925	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus and begins to replicate . after replicating it separates from its twin .
13926	5	the mrna has a code that builds proteins . it fills these codes producing protein until it reaches a stop codon . the protein is then taken to other parts of the body .
13927	5	first mrna leaves the nucleus . then it is taken to the amino acids . which then take is to the endoplasmic reticulum to read the information . last is is made into the protein .
13928	5	the mrna heads to the ribosome .
13929	5	after the message gets sent the proteins then transfer to the dna strand which then gets absorbed into the strand creating a polypeptide bond .
13930	5	in protein synthesis after the mrna leaves the nucleus it enters the cytoplasm . then the trna comes in to deliver the coding of the amino acid sequence to the rrna who then takes the coding to the ribosome to make the proteins .
13931	5	the dna getting its orders to make new protein and the disturbing it through out the body .
13932	5	when the mrna leaves the nucleus that is the first step . the mrna or messenger rna carries instructions to the trna . the transfer rna or trna carry information for building proteins to the amino acid sequence . then more proteins for the body are created through that sequence .
13933	5	the messenger mrna leaves the nucleus . . .
13934	5	. mrna leaves the nucleus carrying instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of the protein . the mrna wraps itself around a protein . the protein takes the information . the mrna splits in two and attached itself to another piece of mrna and creates a new strand of dna
13935	5	after the mrna leaves the nucleus it carries instructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein . i can t remember . i can t remember . i can t remember .
13936	5	. the mrna uses the information from the dna to create codons of the three bases . . anticodons are created to match the codon . . when codons and anticodons are matched they make the enzymes . . enzymes are used to transcribe proteins .
13937	5	it goes to the trna then to the cytoplasm then on a ribosome and comes back to the nucleus .
13938	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus then travels to its designated area . the mrna then delivers the body information that sent it
13939	5	first the mrna finds a ribosome and attached to it . second the anticodon with the amino acid attached to it matches up to the first codon . third a second anticodon matches up and the amino acid from the previous anticodon attached to the other amino acid with a peptide bond . fourth this goes on until the stop codon is read and the protein is complete .
13940	5	anaphase metaphase prophase
13941	5	transition translation
13942	5	it helps the proteins move along faster . it goes through your blood stream and kills all the bad bacteria . it helps build up the protein in your body . it builds up the protein so that way you cant get sick easier .
13943	5	the mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosomes . in the ribosome the mrna is changed into dna . it leaves the ribosome and goes to the rest of the cells then the rest of the organelle in the cell change the dna and do all their jobs .
13944	5	mrna leaves and goes an attached to trna to make the sequence . the the sequence is sent to be the new copied one to the eggs .
13945	5	copies dna and carries it to ribosome and
13946	5	new cell new nucleus fight off virus and replies .
13947	5	it is used then it is digested
13948	5	the peptide bonds link the mrna to the proteins .
13949	5	ribosomes myth elise and breakdown protein .
13950	5	after mrna leaves the nucleus it then goes to make a protein . the codon reads the mrna and transcribes the information sending it to the protein which then travels through out the cell relaying the message or information .
13951	5	one is the mrna leaving two is finding the mitochondria three is the mitochondria making a copy of the mrna and four is the mrna copy is sent to the nucleus .
13952	5	the protein changes over time .
13953	5	one major step was mrna would produce all the waste product . second major step would produce protein . third major step reduce more protein . fourth produce asexually cell and make more molecule .

16450	6	the surface area must increase . the membrane must take in more food or energy .
16451	6	one process is called active transport by carrier proteins . active transport is when substances are moved into a cell against the concentration gradient so energy is used as the carrier proteins bind with the molecule and allow the molecule through the membrane . another process is passive transport by carrier proteins . passive transport is when there is no energy required because the molecules are moving with the concentration gradient . the carrier molecules work the same way as they did for active transport . passive transport by channel proteins is another process . passive transport is the same thing but channel proteins are used as molecules slide through them instead of binding directly to them .
16452	6	one of the ways a cell uses to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is for the mrna to take it across the ribosome . another is the cytoplasm slowly moving it across . a third way is to block off most of the area around the membrane to let only few substances move across the cell membrane at once .

22539	8	the emotions in mr . leonard s words were all too familiar to me . within these words paul gives an indication of his feelings . he is motivated by the fact that he is being trained by a man mr . leonard who in his past broke many track records . however paul is also inspired by mr . leonard s story . because mr . leonard flunked out of college he was ripped away from his passion running track . this encourages paul to work harder to excel in school when all he finds comfort in is hiding when he is overwhelmed by all the things he feels he is not successful at . overall the effect of mr . leonard s background is a positive influence and it reaches out to push paul harder in his endless battle in reading .
22540	8	paul is very surprised that mr . leonard broke records for track when he was a freshman and paul also feels bad for him because he cant read . paul knows what its like to not be able to read because he cant read either so paul wants to help mr . leonard learn how .
22541	8	because paul few in the re medical reading program times
22542	8	when paul finds out who mr . leonard he wondered why he stopped when he was a record breaking track runner . he is also very impressed and humbled that mr . leonard would actually tutor him in track considering he was one of the worst athletes .
22543	8	paul probably thinks in the beginning of the story that mr . leonard is just a bossy grumpy . in the end paul s views of mr . leonard change because of the website paul looks up . paul now seems to be happy for mr . leonard about winning nationals at college for the hurdle race and willing to help him with his reading problem .
22544	8	the background information about mr . leonard has a good impact on paul . paul notices that mr . leonard lived a life similar to his since he could not read well . he also learns how mr . leonard was able to teach him so well because he was once a track star . mr . leonard had broken records for the meter hurdles . he introduced hurdles to paul so that he may have a reason to continue to work hard at school . it shows paul that he can still do something that he enjoys as long as he continues to work hard .

22547	8	the information that paul learns about mr . leonard inspires him to help mr . leonard in the same way that mr . leonard helped him . when mr . leonard explained to paul that he could not read and flunked out of college paul felt a very strong connection because he was not a very good reader himself . paul realized that mr . leonard had given up his time to help paul and that paul could also give up his time to help mr . leonard .

22549	8	after paul gets background information on mr . leonard the effect on him was most likely because of the resemblance of mr . leonard s past and paul s life now . i was a good athlete he said softly but not a good student . we had no learning centers in our school . i relied on friends to help me get by but even then he work was always too hard . mr . leonard was in the same position paul was in except he had no tutor to help him . this made paul feel like someone understood what he was going through . suddenly i realized what i could do for him knowing that mr . leonard can t read after getting to know mr . leonard s background paul wanted to help mr . leonard learn to read .

22552	8	it informs him that not only himself but mr . leonard also has a problem with reading too . he felt claimed when he found out that a runner of such skill has the same problem as himself .
22553	8	when paul finds out that he is not the only one who has trouble with reading he feels more comfortable . he wants to be accepted and not to be the weird dumb kid . it also makes him feel very special that someone took time out of their day to work with him at something and to help him excel at something he might not have otherwise been good at . he felt he needed to repay the man . so at the end he decides to teach him to read .
22554	8	that the coach wasnt good at reading but he had made it to college though with people tutoring him but it was different back in his day . and he wants to prove to paul that he has a special gift and should know what kind of gift it is . but in the story the coach says that he had to relive on his friends to help him and get a tutor when he had gone to college . and that paul is doing the same thing he s relieving on people to help him .
22555	8	the background information given to paul in the story from the coach helps him in showing that no matter how good you are at something you are not really wanted without an education which gives paul motivation to aim for success in school .
22556	8	after paul found the information on mr . leonard he seemed confused . he wondered why mr . leonard had not told him that the man was a track star in college . when mr . leonard slowly unravels the truth and his embarrassment about the matter paul starts to understand exponentially . paul has issues with reading also and he knows how mr . leonard felt . he says the emotions in mr . leonard s words were all too familiar to me . this shows paul s feelings of empathy for mr . leonard and his personal knowledge of the trials people with reading troubles have .

25432	9	the author organizes this article from least important things about space to the most important and most dangerous objects . first the author starts off just talking about space junk then ends off mentioning space craft flying all over outer space at enormous speeds .
25433	9	the scientists are hard pressed for an essay solution to the problem of space junk . in fact the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and or nations have undertaken space exploration . for space junk over the past years a variety of spacecraft including space capsules telescopes and satellites have been sent beyond earth s atmosphere .
25434	9	the author begins the article out in a fun and slightly joking manner . then going into the third paragraph they change their tone to show the seriousness of orbiting debris in space . the author changes the tone and mood after the reader becomes interested so that they learn that space junk is not a joke .
25435	9	he gives an introduction and then start giving out facts before he got deep into what space junk does and what it is and what causes it .
25436	9	the author organizes the article into sections that talk about different topics varying from what space junk is to crashing satellites . the author also adds an intro and a conclusion .
25437	9	the author first catches your attention by rewording a famous quote . then the author goes into the beginning of space travel and how space travel has advanced earth s technology . the third section however explains about the dangers of broken satellites . broken satellites are a very big deal and the author goes into detail about those reasons in the last section . towards the end of the last section the author talks about the specific concerns such as safety and debris containment .

25481	9	he boots a title at the top of each attack .
25482	9	the author first explains what the problem is . then he he shows us the history of space junk and how it came to be . the he says how space junk can affect our lives because of incidents like the satellites crashing into each other . then he says how people do care what is up in space and how they are trying to get rid of the junk .
25483	9	it starts with the start of space exploration and tell more and more in each article until it leads up to the fact that the amount of space trash is still increasing and we need to do something about it .
25484	9	the author organizes this article by building on what he has stated in the previous paragraphs . he also makes it more apparent in the later paragraphs how harmful space junk is to the earth s surface and what kinds of problems it poses for astronaut .
25485	9	he she puts subtitles to show the different problems of space junk and what it is and does .
25486	9	the author organizes the article very well . at one point he will talk about satellites then he will then talk about microdebris . this article has a lot of information in it and i have learned a lot . the introduction grabbed my attention right away very enthusiastic .
25487	9	the author starts out with his introduction and then goes into his facts and details to get his point across .
25488	9	the author breaks down the article into different parts . for an example crash course talks about how satellites crashed into each other . the author also asks questions in his articles which in my personal opinion i like because it sets the tone for the story . finally it makes this article look more interesting instead of it being all one article breaking it up in several mini sections .
25489	9	he try to make it like how difficult its gotten to go through space and how much parts and pieces their is up there .
25490	9	the author uses a p to open his first paragraph . he is trying to engage the reader in the story . he also breaks the information down into different sections .
25491	9	the author organizes the article by having what is space junk to go more detailed in paragraphs as the article went on like crash course to little bits but a big deal .
25492	9	he starts off with something that grabbed my attention and closer to the end i got more interested . they author did a good job keeping me interested and he was very protestant on the topic he never got off track .
25493	9	i think the author organize s the story buy telling you some thing explaining to you what it is and helping you understand what it s to giving you fact s about what it is telling you weren events that have happen to why it is tapping and what is the case and effect .
25494	9	the author organisms it by asking questions then giving you an answer . plus telling other facts about space junk .
25495	9	the author provides the history of each passage to inform the reader of how the space collision will occur or collide .
25496	9	the author organized the article from what happens first and the importance . the author wants to convince the readers about the serious matter of space junk .
25497	9	the author arranges this article in a very organized way . first he she uses an exclamatory attention letter . in the second paragraph the author switches gears and gives background information on how the space junk really becomes junk . next the author talks about a couple different examples of space crashes that have occurred like the crash between an american communication satellite and a russian one as well . in the end the author talks about how important it is that the space junk is taken care of . he she goes on to explain that the particles in space might be small but they can still cause significant damage because of the speed they are moving at . the author organizes the article in a way that can convince the reader that space junk needs to be removed before more damage is done .
25498	9	the author organizes it in a cause and effect sort of way . he introduces something called space junk . he explains what space junk is . once the readers know what space junk is he explains the problem with it . when the readers know the problem he explains that scientists are searching for a simple solution to space junk .
25499	9	the author organizes this article starting off with a few attention grabbing sentences that really stand out . then the author goes into telling the reader what is space junk he informs us a lot about space crafts and telescopes and satellites . the author then starts telling the reader about crash courses and what to look out for in space while driving a space craft such as the bits of debris . those bits os space debris present a very serious problem .
25500	9	the author sections out their paper with headings that have to do with the content it looks good . it is also organized in such a way to make finding things a lot easier .
25501	9	the author starts the article with a surprising and attention getting statement . then he begins explaining the start of space exploration and the invention of satellites . many spacecraft have been sent to outer space over the past years and though they are important to the discovery of what is beyond earth it can be very dangerous and develop a problem . the action of sending spacecraft into space can cause some spacecraft to collide with other spacecraft . these small fragments of the spacecraft can collide with earth and spacecraft and can cause severe damage despite their size .
25502	9	the art cliche orbiting junk is organized by introduction fact hooks and a conclusion . it first gives a hook for the reader line of paragraph and in the next section it provides you with information on he topic at hand which is orbiting space junk . then from there on out you are presented with startling statistics about space junk which is harmful to our biting system in many ways .
25503	9	he goes from getting the readers attention to history to facts . different paragraphs signify greater attentions in a must factual essay . it is organized in a way that anyone can be interested and understand space junk .
25504	9	the author starts out with exclamatory sentences . after that the author states all of the important facts about space junk and satellites . then he talks about the collisions of objects in space that create a crash course .
25505	9	he separates the article into different paragraphs .
25506	9	the author organizes the article in essay style to keep the specific subjects separate .
25507	9	the author organizes this article by something to grab my attention . then some interesting facts the rest was pretty boring .
25508	9	the author organizes this article by splitting up information into different groups . the author did a good job by organizing this article into groups of orbiting junk what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal . the author could of just put all the information in the four articles into one big article but the author wrote headlines supported and wrote about her headlines and moved on to his or her next bit of information .
25509	9	the author starts with an attention grabbing introduction then describes what space junk is then how space junk can be formed and finally how dangerous it can be . i know this because in the paragraph after the introduction it tells about all the different types of things that can be space deere . then in the paragraph after that it tells about how satellites can crash into each other causing deere or a space man losing his tools causing deere . finally the last paragraph describes how space deere can punch holes in a craft or make it hard for a space ship to maneuver through a deere field .
25510	9	he starts off by grabbing the readers attention with exclamation marks . then he gets down to serious business explaining that space junk is a serious problem . he also explain how the debris can cause satellite collisions and how tiny particles of debris can be a big deal .
25511	9	the author organizes the article first by introducing it which is a necessary for the reader to understand what the paper will be about he titles sections and for the introducing section s title he put orbiting junk to inform the reader of what that specific section will be about . the next section is titled what is space junk he goes into explanations of what it is in said section . the section labeled crash course explains what happens when no one is controlling an object . little bits but a big deal colludes the article and informs the reader of why space junk poses a threat and how the problem is worsening .
25512	9	the author organized the article in different sections . he first had his introduction . the article had a section where he talked about the history of space exploration and what space junk really is . then in the crash course section the author wrote about the collisions in space that are causing the debris . finally the article talked about the serious problems that the little debris can cause . this section is informing us to be more aware of the dangers it can cause . the author broke this into sections from least important to the most important .
25513	9	i think the author organized this article in a way that the reader gets roped into it at the beginning with the tone changing part of the way into it . it shows the serious matter of so called space junk
25514	9	this article explains the complication of flying satellites up in space . it goes from information to
25515	9	the author organizes the article with good and understandable tittle that relate to the text that is being talked about and by adding a lot of information and facts about space junk .
25516	9	the author organizes the article in the best way i think possible he makes it clear what the important parts are and how important satellites are . in the introduction the author uses dialog to reel the reader in and to make them want to read more . in the section what is space junk he describes in detail what space junk is . in the section little bits but a big deal he tells the reader how dangerous space junk can actually be to spacecraft .
25517	9	how the author organize this article is by telling us that space junk can be a big problem on space . the need to do many things to help the space by not having junk because they want to improve satellite missions . then they had crash course it is telling us that with no controls that it can risk cold odin ding with one other . than they tell us it was big deal they want us to see that outer space is a very important place and we need to help it . the article was just explaining how we need to improve the outer space by doing all we need to do .
25518	9	he puts it in a way it lets the reader see the information more clearly . he puts it in paragraphs of importance and what there is .
25519	9	th author organizes the article in various sections . starting first with an introduction then onto various subtopics defining space junk space collisions and etc . about the main topic orbiting junk . it then ends with a proper conclusion .
25520	9	the author organizes his article by sections . he starts out with an intro and telling what space junk really is . next he goes on to tell about how debris gets into space . then he stresses the important ance and dangers of the space junk
25521	9	with folded titles from different sections of what the author is about to tell us .
25522	9	the author organize the article three parts and named each statements . the intro suction is talk about space junk but we don t know what it is . first one is what is space junk it explain what is space junk and why space junk was appear . second is crash course it explain crush about two satellites and how danger it was . third is little bits but a big deal it explain small bits about it s danger in the space . and have to find solution .
25523	9	he makes it easier for the reader to understand in what order it happens in .
25524	9	the author organizes the article through the use of subsections . they organize like things into the same subsections . some subsections that are used include what is space junk and crash course . these subsections allow the author to order the article in the correct way . the topics in the article go from space debris to how space debris comes about to the dangers of space debris .
25525	9	the author organizes this article in sort of a chronological type way . for example the first part of the article ends with space junk the next part begins with what is space junk . then he ends the paragraph with disabled object s and begins the next paragraph with dead satellites . when he ends a paragraph he ends with something to lead to another topic .
25526	9	the author organizes the article very well . the article is started off by grabbing your attention and then revealing some important information to give you a little insight on what is to be talked about . the author goes on to speak of the basic history of spacecraft and what exactly space junk is . this informs the reader to build up for later information . facts about collisions of satellites are later discussed which is getting deeper into the topic . it is mentioned that any object can become free orbiting satellites and transitions into how the tiniest object can make the biggest difference . the author sums up the article with more statistics on space junk and informs the reader on the status of the problem and how it has been looked at .
25527	9	the author introduces the topic . the author lets you know what the article will consist of . then provides a brief history of the information . next tells what his her opinion is and what could possibly happen in the future . finally the author states that something needs to be done to fix the problem .
25528	9	states off with an introduction that gets people thinking about what is in space and what is going to happen . then explains what that junk is . thirdly shows what could happen did happen in space . lastly a few facts what happens when things are different in space than on earth .
25529	9	the author organizes the article in a way that makes it easy for the reader understand just what they are obtaining . they put the contents of the passage in order so that you can understand what you will read in the next section . you learn one things so that you can understand something else . the author splits the article up into three different sections . they are written in the order of the least important to the most important .
25530	9	the author explains what happens and how it is caused .
25531	9	the author organizes the article in a very orderly fashion . first there is an introduction the catch the reader s attention and get them interested in the article . it gives the reader an idea of what the article is about . it then talks about the first satellite which was launched in . it goes on to talk about what the satellites do and things that can happen with them . the dead satellites have a risk of colliding with each other which can cause major problems . it just creates more debris . then the article tells the reader about how the speed of space debris can cause major damage . astronauts have to be very careful when taking things into space to prevent adding to the space debris . the article doesn t jump around so that keeps the reader interested .
25532	9	the author goes about getting tour attention and then he gives you the evidence that space junk is dangerous .
25533	9	the author organizes this article by his thoughts or in the order he thinks is right . he starts off with an introduction then explains space junk the crash course and finally little bits but a big deal . so therefore he organized this article by what he thought would be interesting for us readers .
25534	9	the author organizes the article into sub headings . each subheading gives the reader an idea of what the section is about . for example the subheading crash course preludes the information abut satellites colliding . then within each subheading are paragraphs with the information .
25535	9	the way the author organizes the article is by separating the information into different sections by the information that was collected . for example the different information they collected was history about the first artificial satellite that was launched crash courses of satellites and the after effects when the launch takes place .
25536	9	the articles is organized in sections . it has the introduction the body sections with titles like what is space junk and then a conclusion . the author begins the article by starting off in a not very serious tone with his statements in sentences and to grab the reader s attention . then he makes it much more serious of a subject . he informs us of the problem that he will be addressing in later paragraphs in paragraph by telling us what space junk actually is . in the section what is space junk the author gives us some information about the history of space travel and then he tells us the problem of space pollution . in the next section the author tells us about one of the more recent problems with space junk . two satellites collided in mid space in and as a result more space pollution has occurred . in little bits but a big deal a comparison is made between the space junk and a sandblaster to illustrate that even though very small the space junk can be very harmful . in the conclusion we learn that the amount of space junk is increasing because of an increase in commercial space travel and that nations and corporations that take part in space travel in to come together to fix the growing problem .
25537	9	he organizes it into sections or chapters of different information of the main topic which is orbiting junk .
25538	9	the author organizes the article with an attention getting intro . then the article gets serious on telling us how dangerous that space junk is . then it tells us how they can coach into each other in the future causing problems in space .
25539	9	the author organizes his articles by putting them into sections . if each sections talks about something different and goes into detail .
25540	9	the author organizes the article in a very useful way by titling each section on what it is about .
25541	9	by telling us the bad of space junk and what it can do to satellites .
25542	9	the author organizes the article by the most important to the least important statements .
25543	9	the author organizes the arrival in various sections with titles that provide a clue to what the paragraph contains . for example the title crash course hints that the paragraph is about a crash in space resulting in space pollution .
25544	9	he first grabs your attend chen in the very beginning . he starts to describe what space junk . he has the facts from many years a go . the author organizes his thoughts on space junk . he explained how dangerous it can be . the author has lots of detailed information on space junk . he wants to get it clear that space can be dangerous for astronauts . the author tells what they are doing to improve space subtitles and there space suits .
25545	9	it s started off with and attention grabbing introduction asking us a question followed by a brief history giving us an understanding of space junk telling us how its a problem . finally stressing the dangers and extremely of space junk talking about crashes and how even small pieces can cause large amounts of damage .
25546	9	in the first selection it gets your attention by using exclamatory sentences . the second selection explains what you find in space . you are told about what space junk is and how it got there . next in the third selection the author tells you about the dangers of space junk and gives you an example of what can happen . the finale selection summarizes what has been talked about in the other selections . it also tells you that space junk is a major problem that nasa and other space agencies are working on .
25547	9	the author organizes the article in the order of events that take place . the author tells about the first satellites capsules and telescopes that were launched into space . then the author gives all of the information about space junk . the reader learns what is is and how it collides to make even more . finally the author starts discussing solutions and what scientists are doing to help solve the problem . although scientists are trying there are very little advances in finding a solution .
25548	9	he starts of talking about items they use to see in space . then he starts talking about dead satellites . he also talks about the problem their is certain to persist . the amount of space trash increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration .
25549	9	the author organizes the article by first giving personal quotes and inputs . the he continues to give facts to support his points that he is trying to make throughout the article . he splits his paragraphs into split topics so he makes sure he hits each specific detail .
25550	9	he defines what space junk is . he then tells what it is doing and how dangerous it is . then he tells us why people should care and many people do .
25551	9	the author organized this article in three different sections . in the first section he talks about what is space junk this paragraph talks about the historical event of the soviet union and the united states great space invasion . in paragraph two the author gives information about the crash course . the article reads with no one at the controls dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other . that is exactly what happened in february . that was when the american and russians crashed into each other miles above the earth . last but not least section three talks about how the space trash effects us on earth . in the text it says many people do care about the trash and find it as a problem . tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft .
25552	9	that space agencies hope that the corporations and nations involved can work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution .
25553	9	the author organizes this article by order of importance .
25554	9	in this article the author organizes their information in a way to help the reader understand . the author starts out simple but then continues to add on information as the article goes on . the article is split up into four different sections . the first is the introduction grasping the readers attention . the second is defining space junk so that the reader understands more with what s to be further explained . the third is explaining the problem with satellite crashes and space junk crashes . lastly the fourth is applying emphasis on how big of a deal this problem really is and how it could effect us .
25555	9	well first he gives you information . then the author persuades you of the troubles . then he backs up his information . after that he tells us what the harm could do to us .
25556	9	he tried to make an interesting introduction to grab our attention and make us wanting to read more of his article . then he went on to describe what his topic was and about the space junk with details . his next topic was about the crashing course of the space junk and listed some crashes such as a tool bag escaped into the orbit . then to end his article he went on describe the space junk and what it can to do to harm space . he concluded with the nations can work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution .
25557	9	the author gives the intro and them strides and explains what makes up space junk . then he tells the reasons of why its their and reasons for it .
25558	9	the author organized this article in a logical order . the author starts with the introduction moves into describing what space junk is explains what happens when satellites collide and eventually tells why all the small debris is very dangerous . the author has these topics listed under three main topics what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal .
25559	9	to make the reader understand how important space junk is and how it can effect the world
25560	9	the author organizes the article in different paragraphs to show different parts of space junk . like in the paragraph what is space junk he talks about what it actually is .
25561	9	the author organizes the article by putting some humor in the introduction to make it interesting then switching to explaining what has happened in the past . first he tells us what space junk is and explains the how they can be harmful . then he tells us that satellites have crashed into each other creating space junk . then in little bits but a big deal he explains that even the smallest piece of space junk can be seriously harmful if it comes to the earth s surface .
25562	9	this author organizes the article in a very good way . he starts out with a little quote said by two people which is re stated in the article . he then goes to defining what space junk really is . he tells what it is how it got there and what it does up there . he then goes into saying how they run into each other and then states how dangerous is can be .
25563	9	the author starts out with an introduction that grabs your attention . then the author goes into the history of spacecraft satellites then modern day satellites and then what happens when they crash . the author is starting out in the past and moving to the future with the article crash course . the author wants you to know that their are still accidents that happen today even with our technology and also even in space .
25564	9	the author starts off with a very good attention letter . for example when he said grab your telescope look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor it s a . . . . tool bag then the author took a more serious matter and started to explain the dangers of space junk and started throwing out lots of facts statistics .
25565	9	the author organizes the article by going into detail explaining how dangerous most things are in outer space . they say in paragraph that in a tool bag escaped from the grip of an astronaut doing repairs on the international space station . they say dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other that is exactly what happened in february . tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft they say that in paragraph .
25566	9	the author begins this passage by grabbing the reader attention . although the title orbiting junk is humorous the article is not at all . the title is a different way to grab the attention of the reader . after the introduction and the attention grabbing the author talks about things that is very serious around our home . next the article states that two communication satellites on american and one russian both traveling at more than miles per hour crashed into each other miles above earth . which would be interesting to read if someone didn t know about it . last they talk about things that the reader can relate to like a baseball .
25567	9	in categories . . what is junk . crash course and . little bits but a big deal
25568	9	at first glance this article seems to have a simple layout of an introduction and topics . but if you investigate further you will see that after the introduction is a topic that follows up on something mentioned in the introduction . and as the what is space junk section closes with the mention of free floating satellites in space it opens with a section about these satellites colliding . i am very intrigued by this way of organizing thoughts .
25569	9	the author organize it from just things in space as in debris . also with the crash that happen in between americans and the russian .
25570	9	the author begins the article with a catchy fun introduction and then introduces his concerns about space junk . next in what is space junk the author explains how space junk comes to be orbiting outer space . in crash course he brings up the problem of dead satellites colliding with each other using an example . then he talks about the little bits of debris created from these collisions in little bits but a big deal . he explains how these little pieces can cause serious damage but cannot be detected because of their small size . he concludes the article with the fact that this problem is going to persist and something must be done about it .
25571	9	the author organizes the article by using an attention grabber at the beginning . he then proceeds to define space junk and show how humans have created it over the past years . . . with a brief history . paragraph the author explains that free floating debris cases disintegrates and creates new smaller space debris . finally the author explains that this microdebris is causing major problems in space exploration because of the size and the speed at which it travels . the author uses a grain of sand traveling at miles per second compared to a grain of sand in a gently breeze to show the dramatic effects that microdebris can have on a spacecraft satellite or astronaut . the author uses an effective organization of getting the reader interested informing them briefly of the topic and then to get the reader thinking about the topic .
25572	9	the author organized it by category and separating the different parts of the story .
25573	9	the author starts the article with the definition of space junk . the author writes about the history of space junk and how it has become a problem . the author then goes on to talk about how space junk has now become a problem because many satellites are running into each other and becoming free floating objects in space . lastly the author talks about how people care about this growing problem and the ways in which it is trying to be fixed .
25574	9	the author organizes the article by separating each of his major points in to sections with titles . for example the definition of space junk is explained in what is space junk and the problem with space junk is explained in crash course . little bits but a big deal explains the gravity of the situation and proves that even the smallest bit of junk is harmful let alone huge satellites .
25575	9	the author organizes the article in sections . it starts out with an introduction which just describes how the space junk can do to our earth . then it goes into three other sections that explain what it is what causes it and why it is a huge concern .
25576	9	the author clearly separates this article into different categories that helps the reader to better understand the content . for example the title orbiting junk explains what the article is generally about . from the second title what is space junk we can conclude that the author is going to describe just what space junk actually is . from the third and fourth titles we know that the author is going to tell us one of the main factors that causes debris in space and how much of a threat it actually is . the author separates the article into small yet detailed sections so that the reader can better understand the content within it .
25577	9	by putting them into sections . like space junk to crash course and little bits but a big deal . the author put them in order just to show that they are a dangerous thing and that it s not just one little thing it s huge . the author is trying to show and tell you how space junk really is dangerous . it is not something to laugh at our make fun of . if we can t fit our spacecraft through the space junk then there is definitely something wrong . we should not have that kind of problem there shouldn t be anything but maybe one or to satellites in space so we can have our news . we could have emperors and not know it because of all the junk .
25578	9	the author organizes the article by first catching our attention with an introduction then making it serious by explaining what space junk is how it is harming our earth s atmosphere .
25579	9	the author organizes the article by making the paragraphs flow . first it hooks you in with the exciting comments like look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor . those variety of sentences gets you enticed into the story already and makes you want to keep reading . the next way they include organization is by giving information on the issue of space junk . the title what is space junk lets you know that you ll be learning more in depth about the topic . the third type is using facts and information to make the stories seem credible and that the space junk is real . when they use the statistic two communication satellites . . . both traveling at more than miles per hour crashed into each other miles above the earth . that at an alarming rate and it makes the topic they are talking bout seems dangerous . lastly the author uses the strategy of opinions and loaded language to show how serious the issue of space junk is .
25580	9	it starts out as facts then turns into a realization of harmful objects in space start out as satellites .
25581	9	this author tells you about one thing and then the next you know it opens up for the new paragraph about what else is harmful in the space and what has happened in space and what could be done .
25582	9	the author organizes this article by separating the main ideas into their own sections
25583	9	my answer would be about space junk and what it is .
25584	9	by putting it a god order . it was laid out neatly and well organized .
25585	9	first from the beginning the author bring up some question to attract reader attention then he started to explain and define the term of the question and some information after that he provide some examples with different subtitle and also tell us the effect and reason of those example finally he conclusion his question s answer again from the st paragraph .
25586	9	by telling what to do with trash .
25587	9	he organizes each and every section by how they are created and what went down when the united states and the soviet union was in the cold war . the author wants us to know how space craft are used and why they are used in planet we call earth today .
25588	9	the author organized this article almost like a news paper . he starts with a great introduction about things that grabbed the readers attention and motivation to finish this article . after that he starts the body of the arrival and tells the reader about the past of space exploration . next the author tells the reader about two satellites colliding into each other miles away from earth . then the author tells the reader about the problem of microdebris and how it can effect future explorations in space . finally the author concludes his arrival and seriously tells the reader about the increasing problem with space debris .
25589	9	he narrows down about how space junk gets into space and how small and painful microdebris can be .
25590	9	at first he comes out and makes it sound very interesting and try pulling the reader in . then he goes into more detail telling you what are the down falls of the junk in space . he also tells you about how all of the little bits can make a huge deal . the pieces may be small but can do a lot of damage .
25591	9	from when it started the space traveling to up to date exploration
25592	9	the author separates the article into three small sections each with their own titles . the author does this so if the reader is looking for specific information he can look at the titles to find certain things . the first sentence of the entire article shows the author is all about catching the readers attention . the separation of topics into their own titled sections is also a way to catch the readers attention .
25593	9	he starts with exciting statements . then goes into a serious tone into space junk to get into the history of the space race . this leads into sputnik and the americans launching their own satellite . this goes on for years . then it goes on to mention that all these satellites add to the danger of collisions creating debris . this mentions two events one in where an american and a russian satellite collided creating debris and an astronaut loosing a tool belt in . this leads into that even small debris is harmful . that even little grains can damage a spacecraft at great speeds . this adds to the danger when launching into space .
25594	9	the author organizes the article by first telling the subjects history then how dangers it could be and finally how serious the matter really is . ex . over the past years a variety of spacecraft including space capsules telescopes and satellites have been sent beyond the earth s atmosphere . ex . with no one at the controls dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other . ex . tiny fragments traveling at the speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft .
25595	9	the author organizes this article by breaking it up into different sections . these sections are paragraphs that have to do with with one topic .
25596	9	orbiting junk startling statements what is space junk statistics es crash course what could happen and what did happen two satellites at more than miles per hour crashed into each other little bits but a big deal peoples opinions what scientists are going to do about it yet the problem is certain to persist .
25597	9	it is organized by showing what the objects in space are and what they can do to satellites revolving and how they might be damaged do to objects not needed in the gravitational pull of the earth .
25598	9	the author organizes the article in a series of headings and sub paragraphs .
25599	9	the author organizes this article by talking about the dangers of space junk and describes the possible outcomes from it . after it talks about space junk it talks about how things like this have really happened . in february two communications satellites were both traveling at miles per hour and crashed into each other which created hundreds of pieces of debris . that created hundreds of microsatellites flying through space . in the very last section little bits but a big deal that talks about how people could think that it s not such a huge deal but a lot of people actually do .
25600	9	the author organizes the article into three categories what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal . what is space junk defines what space junk is . crash course explains how dangerous space junk can be . little bits but a big deal explains that many people are concerned about space junk and that it is a big deal .
25601	9	the author organizes the article very well . in the begging he or she start out with just a few sentences to grab your attention before they start to address the larger matter . then he or she move on to what is space junk and go back in time to explain how space junk became dating all the way back to during the soviet union . after telling about space junk over years ago then he or she goes into telling about how dangerous space junk can really be . also he or she go into detail towards the end about how even the tiniest junk floating around in space can make a tremendous disaster to a space craft or earth . overall i would have to say that he or she did and amazing job of organizing the right information and kept the article flowing from one detail to the other .
25602	9	the author uses startling statistics he highlights the importance of satellites he supports his facts and he grasp the readers attention .
25603	9	it is good to know what some of the thing are before you read about them so they are in a good order .
25604	9	the author puts all of his information that he wants to share into three different sections throughout the story .
25605	9	it organizes it by telling what happened to the united states spaceship and to the russian s spaceship first . then it tells about all of the debris that floats around in space and how it is bad for the space ships that are up there because they can t see the debris because it said they can t see anything that is smaller than a baseball .
25606	9	the author tells the article of how harmful little bits of items in space will effect the world .
25607	9	the author organizes the article into four sections . they begin with an opening section that tells the reader what the article will discuss . then the three other sections all have headings that give a general idea about what the few paragraphs will be about .
25608	9	the author of this article put the sections into the importance order . he she wants people to understand what the article is talking about then explain what space debris is and what the importance of it is . the explains what happens when these satellites crash and how dangerous it can be to the earth .
25609	9	he organize the article by beginning with simple information and then giving important facts and reasoning .
25610	9	the author of the article organized the article . by first making a hook then some history behind space exploration then they start with how space collisions happen and how they happen . they then end the article with how microdebris is harmful to the space craft that are needed to explore the galaxy and communication satellites .
25611	9	the author of the article orbiting junk organized his information with folded headings . he started in the introduction by getting the reader interested . next he educated the reader on what he was talking about with the heading what is space junk . following this he used the heading crash course to provide an example of an incident . lastly the author concluded with the heading little bits but a big deal to emphasize the impact that space junk has space safety .
25612	9	what he does is he will start off a different topic a different way . like for example grab your telescope look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor it s a . . . tool bag . then the other times he uses a rhetorical question a statistic and random statements .
25613	9	he organized his article by starting off by grabbing the readers attention . this would intrigue the reader to continue reading his article . but then right before the next section they say something that a normal person reading the article would understand . so in the next paragraph they would talk about it and explain it . this is what the author does throughout the whole article . in the article it states this space junk is currently of great concern to government space agencies around the globe . however someone off the side of the road wouldn t understand what space junk is . so then the author goes into another section that is even titled what is space junk this allows the reader to fully understand what the author is trying to explain to the reader . he organized his paper so that it doesn t seem to a reader that he is talking in another scientific language that seems difficult to understand . it allows the reader to understand what the problem is .
25614	9	the author organizes this article by telling the facts from past years to today society . from the beginning it starts out in the then goes to future dates .
25615	9	in the introduction the writer talks about how outer space os filled with clutter and you could basically find anything . in the body he gives details and facts about the united states and spacecraft and such . in the conclusion paragraph the writer explains how things will never change and what could possibly happen if they don t .
25616	9	the author organizes the article by breaking it down into sections . like by the introduction the body paragraphs and then the conclusion instead of just putting all that information into one paragraph . by doing that it makes it much easier to read and go back somewhere that you need to reread or something .
25617	9	even in outer space pollution is a serious problem . clutter and debris are hazardous to earth as well as fellow astronauts . space corporations may probably need to reconsider the construction of space equipment before launching .
25618	9	well he organize his article in to parts like telling people what to do and saying the observation . then underneath it is the story what is space junk so he has him telling directions and then telling a story .
25619	9	the author starts out by using questions sort of in a funny way it s a . . . . tool bag . next they go on describing the problem what is space junk . then they describe the causes of it . finally they explain how a little thing can cause so much damage .
25620	9	the author organizes the arrival by putting each important fact in a category all its own . take what is space junk for example it explains what space junk is and how dangerous it cud be to the earth . in the section titled crash course it talks about the risks of dead satellites colliding with one another . in february of communication satellites one american and one russian collided with one another .
25621	9	the author organizes the article with headings . they are what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal . within each of the headings the author also uses specific examples that relates to the heading it is under .
25622	9	the author tells you all about the space junk and what has happened to space in the year s . the author also explains everything to the reader so they know that the author is not just playing around this is a serious matter and the author want s the reader to understand that . the author help s the reader in a way so that they understand how thing s got this way in first place which is a good thing because it make it easier for the reader to understand where the author is coming from .
25623	9	he organizes it from small and simple problems to big and complex conflicts .
25624	9	the author organized the information he gathered well . his introduction paragraph obviously wanted to catch your attention and to draw his reader in . secondly he informed his reader about what exactly space junk is . he taught me what happens to the satellites that stop working and gave me some history . in the third section crash course i felt that he still gave me some history about the satellites . in the last section i felt that he the author scared me a little bit to help me become more aware of how dangerous it is to have floating things in space .
25625	9	this article is laid out by topical organization . this is evident because of the fact that there are four different labeled sections in the story each for a different topic of the subject . for example the section titled what is space junk explains what space junk is while the section titled little bits but a big deal explains why people should be worried about space junk .
25626	9	the author organizes this article by first using a funny and catchy introduction to get the reader s attention and get them interested in the subject . as you read on though the author next uses statistics and facts and changes the tone from funny to serious to indicate to the reader that even though we might not think about the space debris too much that it poses a serious threat to humanity . he uses a specific story to show what he means about when the two satellites crashed into each other . then he goes through explaining why the space debris is so dangerous and why its such a serious matter . he explains that even though the debris is small that with high speeds they cause a lot of damage . he then describes what we are trying to do to solve and prevent more of the damage from happening but at the end tells us how even though we know its dangerous the space debris is still increasing and that we are still trying to come up with a solution for it .
25627	9	the author separates out different problems of space debris from what it actually is to how the remains from a crash create thousands of little pieces and this number of pieces is ever increasing . the author talks about how space junk first found its way in orbit during the dawn of space exploration over years ago how being so far from the earth s atmosphere keeps them from degrading which makes them last longer and therefore makes them more likely to be in a crash at some point .
25628	9	the author does a great job of organizing this article . they really set up the information well . they tell you about space junk and they give you a background history on space exploration .
25629	9	the author organizes it by asking us questions at the beginning of the story giving us facts in the introductions . then it goes down to what is space junk it explains that very well it quotes over the past years a variety of spacecraft including space capsules telescopes and satellites have been sent beyond earth s telescopes .
25630	9	in sections like the introduction to the little bits but a big deal
25631	9	really good .
25632	9	the author puts questions in the first paragraphs and then answers them in complete thought and ideas .
25633	9	the author organizes his article very well . he made the article into different sections so if you are just interested in one subject the you can just read that section . for example if you are just interested in satellites crashing then you can just read crash course .
25634	9	the author organizes the article by first talking about what is space junk then how they are dangerous and what they do to cause damage . the first part describes what space junk is and how it is formed in the atmosphere . the second part is describing how it can become dangerous when pieces break off . the third part is saying how they have caused damaged and how dangerous they really are . in conclusion this article is talking about what space junk is and how the government is concerned by it .
25635	9	the author defines what is considered space junk in the first section of the article . from there the author explains what can happen with the junk that is floating around in the orbit . it is explained that the satellites can collide making even smaller debris float in space . this small debris can cause a spacecraft to malfunction horribly . in the ending section of the article the author states that even the tiniest pieces of debris can have a huge impact .
25636	9	the author organizes the article into three main sections and an introduction . the introduction has a title aptly named orbiting junk because the character finds a tool bag in space . the second two articles provide information . the article titled what is space junk divulges background information on the subject to the reader . the third section tells what happens to satellites in space and how they are a problem . the fourth article tells what can be and what is being done to prevent and overcome this problem .
25637	9	the author organizes this article by putting the information in sections . each section talks gives different information about space junk and space history . the author divides the information in three different categories called what is space junk crash course little bits but a big deal .
25638	9	the author organizes the article so that he drags the the readers into the article .
25639	9	he organizes it in telling about the history and the outcome of the accident .
25640	9	he starts the article with the basic introduction to tell what the article is about such as orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions . then it is saying what causes the space junk and it s from satellites colliding in space . then it tells about what the is the big deal with space junk and the dangers of it .
25641	9	the articles are organized by the satellite sections and the debris that is caused in space . and the difficulties the debris puts on the satellites .
25642	9	the author introduces the article with giving an example of space junk . it s a . . . tool bag then the author explains in further detail what exactly space junk is . . . . what happens when a satellite dies or malfunctions and can t be prepared this object becomes a piece of high tech junk . . . then the author goes on to explain what can happen from the space junk in space . lastly the author tells us how the debris from the collisions can lead to very serious problems .
25643	9	the author organizes the article by having the general information first and then the explanation of how the debris can effect the earth how it effects us and why this issue is around . in the article the author starts out with the general statement and then clear ivies any questions about the main subject . second the author tells us how the debris got there . lastly the author tells us why it is harmful to the planet and us .
25644	9	the author organizes the article by putting the different topics into different sections . he titles one section what is space junk
25645	9	he organizes the article into different sections so that you can find what your looking for easier .
25646	9	the author organized this article by using subheadings . he used the subheadings what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal . the subheadings make it easier for the reader to find the information they are looking for . under the subheading what is space junk one might find the definition of space junk . . . . what happens when a satellite dies . . . the disabled object becomes a piece of high th junk cycling the globe in uncontrolled orbit . this explains what space junk is and how it become space junk . the subheading crash course might emphasize what will happen if the space junk s orbits cross . two communication satellites . . . crates into each other . . . now instead of two disabled satellites there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space . this explains what happens when the paths of disabled satellites cross . the subheading little bits but a big deal might discuss hoe the microdebris can have a harmful effect . . . . the amount of space trash is actually increasing . . .
25647	9	the author organizes his article in a very peculiar way . it first starts with a great attention letter showing what space junk is . then he talked about the history of the junk why it is there . next he describes the crashes that can occur due to space junk . he ended with what space junk is doing and how harmful it really is .
25648	9	the author organizes his ideas by putting them into titled paragraphs . each subject does not flow so well together so he put them separately to emphasize each paragraph .
25649	9	that there is space junk all over the space and it could hurt the earth and the space centers in space .
25650	9	the author organizes the the article very well in my opinion . the author tells what goes on in space and all kinds of details about it .
25651	9	with new caption before every parade .
25652	9	the author organizes the article by facts . he wrote his sub titles and puts down the information needed to explain the heading .
25653	9	the author organize the article by the most important to the least important . he starts off with the biggest problem space junk and ends with little bits but a big deal . he tells how the little bits of space debris is a serious problem but space junk is a much bigger problem .
25654	9	the author tell what is space junk he also gives more information about the satellites . he also mean chess about the crash course . in paragraph six branches that when no one is at the controls the dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other . the other detail information was in paragraph eight little bits but a big deal . that s talking about how it is a problem to the space program . like in paragraph eleven saying in fact the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration . in paragraph it also mean chen how the little things in space can be difficult for space craft .
25655	9	he does it very well .
25656	9	the author explains differently in many paragraphs how space junk can be a hazardous to the atmosphere .
25657	9	he organizes it by explain the dangers held within space trash . in the first two articles he explains what space trash is and identifies that it is a huge problem .
25658	9	the author organizes the article into well defined titled sections each describing the title in detail . one of the sections called crash course is a two paragraph section on how satellites become debris . first a paragraph on large satellites that collide to create tiny microsatellites . the next a paragraph on less spectacular crashes . how astronauts may accidentally lose something in the great vacuum of space .
25659	9	the author starts his story with a an ctodatol lead then the author talks about a problem . explained why this problem occurs . finally tells what will happen in the future why it harms the earth and how this might effect us by saying that more sat lights will hit each other and our orbit around earth will be clustered in the near future .
25660	9	he organized the article by using pacific titles for each paragraph he writes and includes information that is regiment to the title in each section of the titles .
25661	9	the author organizes the arrival by telling what is in outer space and what can and has happened in outer space . the author describes the danger and tells how it could hurt the earth .
25662	9	the article has an introduction some background and history of space junk then it talks about the problem of space junk and how it collides with each other the it ends with the big problem and how it should and could be fixed .
25663	9	the author organizes this article into mini chapters . the chapters cover main topics that the author talks about most . the first chapter is called what is space junk . the author then supports this rhetorical question with two paragraphs . the second paragraph titled crash course is also supported by two paragraphs . the last paragraph little bits but a big deal is supported by three paragraphs .
25664	9	the author organizes the article by first getting you hooked . they catch your attention . then the author introduces what the article is really about . next it explains space travel and uses details to support the argument that this is a problem .
25665	9	the author organizes his article based on the severity of the matter . first he starts out explaining what exactly space junk is . then he moves on to hint at the possibility of debris crashing into important space objects such as satellites . he finally puts more emphasis on the subject by sharing truths that have happened in the past and what could become of these flying invisible baseballs .
25666	9	the author starts out by talking about how odd it is to see a tool bag in space just floating around . then the author goes into explaining what space junk is . the author gives examples of what would be considered space junk . then the author has a paragraph titled crash course . this paragraph is talking about how the satellites that are sent out into space are not controlled by anybody . they are just out there . the author also talks about how when the satellites crash into each other how big of a deal that is . the satellites crashing into each other creates space junk . the author also has a paragraph titled little bits but a big deal . this paragraph is talking about how people think that little space debris isnt as big of a deal as people make it out to be . the author gives an example of throwing sand at something or shooting it through a sandblaster and the difference in impact . this paragraph is pretty much telling you that it doesn t matter how big or small the debris is it can still do a lot of damage .
25667	9	the author organizes this article by what its about to what is it that can it do .
25668	9	he put the different topics that people may want to know about in different sections of the story . like separating the information about satellites from space junk .
25669	9	the author organizes the article in a way that shows how satellites get to where they are then what happens if they were to get disabled and collide and finally the potential dangers it creates .
25670	9	he organizes the article by putting titles at the beginning of a new section and that tells the reader that something else is about to happen . the subject is about to change and the author does this by having titles . you do not see this very often you usually just see an indent to start a new paragraph and a new idea . he starts it off really good and that draws the reader in and then he begins with all the facts and everything about space junk .
25671	9	he uses sub titles to organize the article .
25672	9	he breaks it down into categories of each specific branch of information
25673	9	he puts the information in order .
25674	9	the author starts off with an introduction from the readers point of view then the author give a little information about space junk and what its made from . the the author talks about why there is space junk . the last paragraph talks about why space junk is dangerous and all the effects it could have .
25675	9	the author organized the article by using thing that the reader might actually interest a person .
25676	9	the author first has the introduction and his attention grabber it s a . . . tool bag . the next three sections what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal are all separated and organized by category of information . for example the section what is space junk gives a background history of space junk but the section crash course is all about satellites crashing into one another .
25677	9	the author organizes the article by first grabbing your attention and then giving you facts .
25678	9	he explains it in detail from beginning to the end
25679	9	the author organizes the article by having a introduction and a middle and an end .
25680	9	the author organized the article by different topics . the first paragraph is about a comet but it really wasn t one it was just a tool bag . the next one was about what is space junk . then the second to last topic was about that stuff we leave in space will come down and have a crash course toward earth . the last topic is little buts but big deal something small from space can fall to earth and still leave a very big impact on earth .
25681	9	the author organizes the article in different section . in the first part of the article the author explains what space junk is . in the second part the author explains how the space junk got there . in the last part of the article the author explains how the space junk is a problem and is dangerous .
25682	9	by creating smaller sections of the reading with catchy titles the author makes the passage more direct on certain subjects . that also allows the author to talk about several different topics throughout the passage . engaging the reader and keeping them engaged is sometimes a problem and with the different interesting titles the reader is constantly re engaged .
25683	9	the author organizes in a way that builds up on the topic . first the author talks about what is space junk and when it started . second the author gives information on when the space junk actually became a problem in the crashing of two satellites . last the author explains that little things can have a big impact .
25684	9	the author had supported towards the fact because he had been to the space ship and flew to the moon and experienced the moon .
25685	9	he comes in week but finishes strong
25686	9	think the author organized the article in order of importance . i think he did this to build up to to show that little bits in space are often over looked but they are so important as any other things .
25687	9	the author organizes the information by starting with the main title and then followed by subtitles to divide the information into different categories .
25688	9	he begins by explaining space junk and the history of it . then he explains how dangerous all of the microdebris can be considering there is very much of it around space . crashes happen often . finally he explains how much people care about the debris and how its not just an ignored problem . it can cause serious damage .
25689	9	the author organizes the article in chronological order . they start each paragraph with a question and then they answer it in a well thought out paragraph putting things in an order that can be easily understood by the readers .
25690	9	he starts the article off by getting the reader s attention with a real scenario . after he has the reader s attention he changes the tone of the article to more a serious mood . he does this to emphasize the importance of the space junk . he first explains what space junk is then explains the harm it can cause then explains that even though it s small it is a serious matter .
25691	9	the author organize the article by dividing it into sections . first section is about orbiting junk . second is what is space junk . the third is about the crash course . at but not least is the little bits but a big deal .
25692	9	the author first grabs your attention with the interesting introduction . he then continues on to talk about satellite collisions to explain why some space junk exists . then he shares some important facts about space debris and makes it evident that it is a serious matter .
25693	9	the author organizes the article by first explaining what space junk is . then the author goes on to tell us that crashes have happened and then explaining what a threat the space junk can be .
25694	9	the author organizes the article by assigning the information to its own section and giving the information a title . for example the title what is space junk gives information about all of the different junk we send up into space explains how it comes back to earth and why this is so on needed .
25695	9	in paragraph form with more than one headings .
25696	9	i personally think that it is a good article . the author has done a very good job . with using the history of nasa and others . another thing i really like about it . is there is a title for each new paragraph . to help the reader stay clear of confusion . and mushed together paragraphs . i also like the opening introduction to this little story .
25697	9	first the author will give you information about why satellites went into space . then he will will lead into telling you how uncontrolled satellites are more likely to run into each other and when they do a lot of deere is let out in space . after that he explains how when astronauts go into space they should be super careful so they do not let any more deere go into space because is it not needed . later he goes into how more space junk is actually increasing and he hopes corporations work together to help stop this .
25698	9	first he starts out with a small question to draw you in . then he gives you facts about space junk and says how to fix it .
25699	9	the author begins with an exciting hook that makes you want to read more . grab your telescope . . . then he adds a sense of humor when he says it s a tool bag then after his introduction he describes what space junk really is . then he records the dangers of having space junk or for example dead satellites floating around in space . they are at risk of colliding with each other . he explains how after the crash instead of sat titles roaming around there was now hundreds of pieces of debris flying through space . to us we may not see the harm in little bits flying around but he goes on to inform us on how it is a big deal . concluding with space trash being a serious issue .
25700	9	he give titles for all section of the article that us readers can follow most ears than a big summary of the orbiting junk in are space .
25701	9	the author titles each new section . there are four sections all together including the introduction there are what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal .
25702	9	the author organizes the passage with three main topics in addition to the introduction . the author defines space junk gives specific examples of it and expresses potential danger it could bring . a specific example occurred in when two fast moving satellites collided forcing hundreds of microdebris pieces into the gravitational pull of earth .
25703	9	the author organizes the article by braking it down into small sections that to together help you fully understand the article .
25704	9	the author organizes the article orbiting junk in a specific way . the author begins by grabbing the reader s attention with lines such as grab your telescope look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor it s a . . . tool bag the article goes on to describe what space junk actually is and the outcome it has on planet earth . deeper in the article a reader can find examples of satellite crashes in the segment titled crash course . the author gives an example of when two communication satellites crashed into each other in february of . the author closes the article by describing that even the smallest of debris can make a difference in the solar system .
25705	9	the author organizes the article horribly
25706	9	the author organizes the article with
25707	9	he starts by showing some history of space lances into space . then he talks about that over time that satellites become junk that can make problems in space for satellites that are still good . and that we need to start beefing more careful about we do down in earth .
25708	9	the author organizes it by telling exactly what it is at the beginning by having one of the sections named what is space junk then tells some issues about what damages space junk can cause in the section titled crash course . telling how all that junk got into outer space in the first place . then the author finishes off with the section little bits but a big deal . this section talks about who cares about space junk and how to prevent it .
25709	9	starting with an introduction that explains personal statements . then to explaining what the term space junk actually means . from statistics to many interesting facts it explains how it gets there what happens to it and how bad it is effecting space .
25710	9	the author starts with an introductory and then uses titles for different subjects the author is talking about . the author does this to better organize the article . separating into different stories is easier and lets the reader understand what she is writing about before they read it .
25711	9	the author organizes the article by giving an early history of the first satellites up to more of the modern day ones . in the last paragraph it talks about space debris .
25712	9	the author organizes the article by putting different articles on different pages and the layout has to be put a certain way and things have to be perfect . there cannot be any errors spelling mistake typos nothing like that . the paper is only allowed to be so many pages so there can t be any articles too long or there can t be too many .
25713	9	explains the history of space junk .
25714	9	the author organizes the article by first describing what sac junk is then going on to tell you about how it can be dangerous .
25715	9	the author arranges it by importance . such as drawing the reader in with exclamation marks and exciting phrases then moves on to more serious explaining .
25716	9	the author starts out the article by trying to grab your attention and make the article seem appealing to the reader . he does this by saying grab your telescope look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor it s a . . . . tool bag this quote does do the job of grabbing the reader s attention because it s a very common catch phrase that he uses . next the author describes just exactly what space junk is by giving the history of space exploration within the human race . the paragraph is titled what is space junk he states how exactly the satellites and other objects because this junk the objects themselves however are positioned hundreds of miles above the earth far from elements that would cause them to degrade or burn up . in this airless environment some of them continue to circle the planet indefinitely . this paragraph also explains that when a piece of high tech junk is disabled that it just orbits around the earth uncontrollably . within the next two paragraphs the author gives different facts as to how the space junk is harmful two communications satellites one american and one russian both traveling at more than miles per hour crashed into each other miles above the part . the impact created hundreds of pieces of debris each assuming its own orbital path . it goes on with describing the different dangers that these paths of debris cause .
25717	9	i think that the author organizes the article in order from most important to least important . te author uses a lot of details in the beginning but not as many in the end . but the author definitely uses a lot of details through the whole article .
25718	9	the author is building up on the importance as the article goes on . starting with just saying there is space junk and ending with there is a lot of it and we can not see what is smaller than a base ball .
25719	9	the arrival is starting with telling us what space junk is . then the arrival is running the through the history . finally it gets into the size and define of it .
25720	9	the orbital pathway around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions .
25721	9	the author organizes this article by splitting it into different sections . the sections include orbiting junk what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal . the author split his article into these four sections to make his article organized so the reader can quickly find what they need to read .
25722	9	the author organizes the article into section that have different purposes .
25723	9	the author organized the article by telling what the readers really don t know much about . like what space junk is and how does it effect things in space . then it leads into how satellites really work
25724	9	he likes to split it up into section topics . then the author just goes on and on with his story .
25725	9	he organizes it in a section form . he takes all the information that is related to each other and splits it up into similar groups
25726	9	the author organizes this by giving you examples and descriptions on the reality of space . how just little pieces of space junk can jepidize a mission towards space .
25727	9	the author tells how space junk is a big deal . then starts with how it gets to become space junk . then the author talks of how we have to detect it and try to avoid it and what problems occur because of it .
25728	9	this article is divided up into smaller sections to make it easier to read . each section has a title such as crash course to let the reader know what information will be presented in that section . there are so many different topics about space junk that the author covers in this article such as how space junk got into space and how it can cause problems for spaceships that breaking it up with the interesting titles was good organization by the author .
25729	9	he starts with a strong introduction that grabs the readers attention . he then begins to discuss different important facts about space . he tells the things that go on in space and the problems that occur . he also speaks on the opinions of people and how they actually care about space debris with it being a series problem . last he tells about the scientists and how space agencies are working together to come up with a way to basically stop space pollution . the author organized this article very well because it flows nicely and gives great detail .
25730	9	the author begins with an introduction to grab the attention of the reader using startling statements and an interesting rhetorical question . he then switches the tone of the article to more serious and informational . he categorizes information into three categories what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal . the first category tells the reader about how space junk is formed and what it consists of . furthermore the second category delves further into the topic of the magnitude of crashes between satellites orbiting the earth . additionally the third category informs the reader about why tiny particles in space orbiting the earth are very dangerous . in sum the author organizes the article in this fashion to help the reader understand the detriments to space junk .
25731	9	the author organizes the article into individual titled sections which each address a very specific aspect of space junk or further explain the issue it creates in the atmosphere . after the introduction three sections sections follow each of which consists of two to four paragraphs . what is space junk explains the concept of debris orbiting the earth in space and how it came to be . crash course begins to explore the dangers of such debris . lastly little bits but a big deal emphasis es the seriousness of the issue of space junk .
25732	9	first the author explains to the reader what space junk is . then the example of the american and russian satellite crashing is presented to show how the crashes create debris . finally the author goes into detail about how the space junk is very dangerous and how many organizations are searching for a solution to the problem .
25733	9	the author organizes the article by introducing the topic explaining its importance and an providing supporting details . the passage informs the reader about space debris . then the author continues to give information about its dangers . finally they give examples of what various sizes and types of debris can damage or destroy . it also informs the reader of difficulties it can cause .
25734	9	the author draws you in with the introduction then explains what space junk is and how it has become a problem . the author also explains how space junk ended up in orbit in the first place . then the author explains how dead satellites create even more space junk after they collide with another satellite or any other space junk freely orbiting the earth . lastly the author explains how dangerous this space junk can really be and all the damage it could cause .
25735	9	the author went from small problems to big problems that he more effect on us . the author started out with describing the what things were in space to what they could do while they are up there .
25736	9	the article has a catchy introduction . it asks exciting questions to get the attention of the reader . after the opening the writer goes directly into the body of the paragraph beginning with facts definitions explanations and details such as space junk what it causes sizes and similes comparing microdebris to sandblasters . towards the end the writer explains how littering in space can cause great problems to orbiting spacecrafts . the writer explains this by saying that little bits are a big deal .
25737	9	the author organized the article because many people do . also so he did it because certain to persist can be a problem . space agencies hope that the corporations and nations involve can work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution
25738	9	the author organizes the article by making the introduction interesting then the important information about space . using newer information and also using some space history which makes it more interesting knowing what space was like years ago and how it could be different now .
25739	9	the author organized it in ways with different kinda stuff on every one
25740	9	the the author organized the arrival by sub topic . every sub topic has its own title such as crash course or little bits but a big deal .

25747	9	the author organizes this article into sections . each section has a different subject . the paragraphs are orbiting junk what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal . these are ways to explain the different subjects .
25748	9	the authors starts out with an introduction and a definition of what space junk is . the author then tells us of ways that space junk is created and then finishes by talking about the effects and possible problems of the future .
25749	9	the author starts out in the beginning telling you how all of the space debris started to become what it is . the author then tells you how all of this poses a threat to everything that leaves earth atmosphere to go to another planet or to just work on a satellite .
25750	9	the author starts out by having a topic paragraph to interest the reader . then he explains that many spacecrafts have been sent beyond earth s atmosphere . in crash course he explains that spacecrafts can crash into each other and debris flying around . he then explains that even if the debris is small it s still dangerous .
25751	9	the author organizes the article by describing the processes in which space junk can be harmful .
25752	9	the author organizes his thoughts very well . he has and introduction that gets the reader interested grab your telescope look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor not only does this start off getting you interested but it also ends with a sort of puzzling statement . it s a . . . tool bag the he moves on to what is space junk here he moves onto describing and defining what space junk is and how it can be deadly .
25753	9	he organizes it by spreading the different topics . first he was talking about orbiting junk then he was talking about like what is space junk and other stuff like that .
25754	9	the author organizes the article in the best way that he can to inform you about space junk . he starts off with what is space junk which tells you all about it and what it is . then he tells you about what happens when they crash into things and how big of a deal it all really is .

25756	9	he tells what is space junk how it can get into space and that no matter the size any thing that is floating around out there is harmful .
25757	9	an attention grabbing beginning followed by explaining what space junk is then saying that old satellites run the risk of crashing into each other and debris hitting the earth followed by the dangers of micro debris .
25758	9	the author organizes the article by splitting it up into four sections that each have a different focus . the first section is the introduction which states the topic and expresses the importance of the subject . this is proven when the article states that this space junk is currently of great concern to government space agencies around the globe . the following section what is space junk proceeds to explain exactly what space junk is and how it is created when it states that disabled objects commonly from dead satellites circle the globe in an uncontrolled orbit . the third section crash course focuses on the dangers of dead satellites crashing into each other . the section states that after a satellite crash instead of two dead satellites orbiting in space there are hundreds of microsatellites which can be much more dangerous . the last section little bits but a big deal restates the dangers of debris flying around in space and emphasis es the situations they can cause . the sections states that at extreme speeds little bits can pack a punch powerful enough to create disastrous holes in an object moving through space . the author separates the article into sections to help the reader understand certain aspects of space junk in a more organized manner .
25759	9	space pollution can change and hurt the planets
25760	9	in this article the author uses a hook in the introduction to get the reader involved in the story and wanting to read more . the author then changes the tone and expresses the seriousness of the topic . they begin to give background on what has happened in the past and how much damage it has done . the author is trying to give the reader information on how big of a deal they feel space junk is to our orbital pathways .
25761	9	the author organizes this article by starting with a introduction . then the author goes on to explain the history of space junk and how it began . the author then goes on to explain the impact space debris does to other satellites along with some statistical information about space junk . the author finishes the article with a conclusion
25762	9	he explains about the objects in space the junk that is found in there and then he goes on telling about how the objects got to space and in what way they have affected earth . he tried to tell things that cause this nd then he tells of how they are going to affect us and how they have increased .
25763	9	the author starts with some statements to get the reader interested then goes into when the first natalie was shot into space . the author then talks about what happens to satellites that died and were free orbiting the dangers that could happen when satellites began to crash into each other . then the author ends with explaining the after effects of a crash and the harm it does .
25764	9	first he comes off with humor to get you interested . then hits you with the serious stuff . he then he tells what space junk is . then finally tells you about the crash problem and why it is so important to care .
25765	9	the author catches the attention of the reader by making a statement of something that is in realistic when saying there is a tool bag in the sky . then it goes on to tell what space junk is or the stuff that floats around in our orbit that we can still see . after explaining that is tells of how the debris gets there and how it is harmful to further studies of outer space or even the astronauts there to study it . the article is all put into place to tell the readers of how a small matter has turned into a very big problem for astrology .
25766	9	the author organizes the article by different paragraphs and titles . the introduction sets up the scene and presents the problem . the first section what is space junk helps the reader understand all of the debris that pollutes our atmosphere . the second section crash course tells the reader about the crashes and collisions that happen in space . and finally the little bits but a big deal section presents how we have tried to fix the microdebris problem in space .
25767	9	the author organizes the article by diving it into sections with headings . each heading has information under it that corresponds to the heading .
25768	9	first the author grabs the readers attention with the opening paragraph . then they go on to tell the readers about what space junk is . next they talk about how satellites and other things in space crash into each other . last they explain how just the simple small things that float in space are harmful .
25769	9	the author organizes this article with different headings for different information . these headings preview the information to follow . these different headings explore many key items in explaining the space junk problem .
25770	9	has like exciting comments in the beginning . then through out the middle gets serious and tells the importance of what he is talking about . he also gives examples and many details . then wraps it up by saying that something needs to happen for it will get worse .

25777	9	the author separates his article into different sections and gives them different titles . like first he starts off with an introduction that is an attention letter line grab your telescope look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor line it s a . . . tool bag readers would be confused and shocked on why there is a tool bag floating in space because its unusual .
25778	9	the author first introduces the topic by showing that space junk can sometimes be mistaken for comets or meteors . next he or she explains what space junk is and how it got into space . following next is the explanation that if too much space junk is up in space satellites will collide with each other like two did in february of . he or she then makes a further explanation between the tiny space particles and speed saying if the space junk was tiny particles of sand blowing in a gentle breeze they would not be dangerous . however when being blown from a sandblaster to take paint off of a concrete wall the space junk particles become extremely dangerous . the author then explains that space agencies are striving to make new developments in space travel safer by building extra walls on space ships and making thicker space suits to try to reduce the impact of the particles . the author then finishes it up saying space agencies are working together to try to find a solution for space pollution .
25779	9	the author organized this article by breaking it up into its only little sections like orbiting junk what is space junk crash course little bits but a big deal .
25780	9	he starts off by catching the readers attention then goes into history next facts and then what needs to be done and what can happen with space junk in the conclusion .
25781	9	the author starts out by stating that you can observe space junk and it isn t as strange as it seems . the author goes on to explain what space junk is and how it got there . then explains that when the technology goes dead the risks of the satellite crashing into another and then the pieces crashing on earth become higher . he goes on to explain that these little pieces of space junk even if they down crashing into earth they are still a threat to astronauts who are on space missions .
25782	9	he does so by making vital of sections and then going in detail on such topics listed in the arrival .
25783	9	the space junk one is talking about the things that happen and or that can happen and stuff of spacecraft and about the earth and stuff . the crash course is talking about the dangers and that sort of stuff .
25784	9	the author organizes the article by telling us the main ideas in order from least important to most .
25785	9	talks about the space junk and the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite . then the crash course and talks about the crash . the little bits but a big deal and talks about how space has trash floating around .
25786	9	the author opens with a interjections to help grab the reader s attention . he then shifts into historical facts and analysis to show the dangers of space junk . the author proceeds to tell about the effect that space junk can have on spaceships and satellites and the risk that they can put on them . this helps show how space junk is a serious matter that can make or break a space exploration mission .
25787	9	the author starts the article with stating that space junk is common in space he then answers the question on what exactly is space junk with details . he then explains the dangers of space junk and how to fix the growing problem .
25788	9	first he uses some shocking statements to draw the reader in . then elaborates on some terms given in the introduction and gives examples of them . explained the danger of them tells how the space junk can be formed such as a tool box slipping out of a astronauts hand or two communication satellites traveling at miles per hour colliding with each other . he ends with explaining why all the little pieces are important and especially the larger pieces .
25789	9	he organizes it by writing the space events in order and telling about them in alphabetical order .
25790	9	the author organizes the article by presenting in the introduction that space junk is a concern . after the introduction the author explains to the reader what space junk is . then the author tells about instances where two satellites collided and how a tool bag escaped an astronaut in space . after that the author explains the problems that debris in space can make and that space agencies hope corporations and nations can work together to come up with a solution to colliding debris in space .
25791	9	in the first part of the article the author describes what space junk is . then he explains what the problems are with space junk just floating around in the air . then he gave examples of what could happen with all of the space junk in the air .
25792	9	the author starts off the passage getting your attention by relating it back to your life . than the author talks about a time frame . than the author talks about how space debris can be dangerous . finally the passage says why we should be careful around these debris fragments because they can seriously harm the rockets we launch .
25793	9	the author uses the introduction to hook you in to reading the essay than uses startling facts about space junk and than talks about different items that are space junk .
25794	9	in the article he shows how the stuff in space can be very harmful to spacecraft in the sky . it could hurt someone or even kill them from the fall of the spacecraft .
25795	9	the author tells about how bad things can happen up in space . he goes from the worst to not as bad . just like the two satellites colliding .
25796	9	the author organized this very well . he used an introductory section three main points and a conclusion . i very much liked his introductory section it really draws you in .
25797	9	at first the author identifies the subject . then provides some history about the subject . next the author talks about how trash in space gets to small pieces and how it affects space exploration . lastly the author states problems that have been caused and problems that are still and will be caused if space explorations are continued also maybe how to stop it and keep debris under control .
25798	9	the author organize the article by breaking each topic down in sections .
25799	9	i think the author is well organized is this article . the author starts talking about what space junk is and how important satellites are . then the author goes into greater detail and importance with the satellite issue . the author then tells us how satellites crash and how much damage it is to the earth s atmosphere . then the author finishes off with how the microdebris is harming our atmosphere greatly .
25800	9	the author starts the article with some interesting rhetorical questions to get the reader s attention . he then talks changes the mood of the article of a more serious sense so because the matter can cause damage . he talks about some different things in space and provides multiple facts . he ends with talking about how the space pollution can pose a serious problem .
25801	9	they start off with an attention grabbing beginning . grab your telescope look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor it s a . . . tool bag then they get all serious and go into what is space junk then crash course and little bits but a big deal .
25802	9	the author starts out with a good attention letter . then gives a little information of the background about the topic . from there the author states problems caused by all the space debris .
25803	9	first he explains what space junk is then how it is harmful .
25804	9	the author organizes the article by first grabbing the reader s attention explaining the topic giving more specific details and then stating the effects of space debris . the author attracts the reader by stating that instead of finding a meteor or comet in the sky one may see a too bag . in the next paragraph there are details listing what space junk is . next the author tells of the history of space junk . lastly the author emphasizes that space junk can be undetected harmful to other space devices and that space debris is pollution .
25805	9	author organizes the article into subsections that cover an area of importance to the article . the first article what is space junk talks about how object themselves however positioned hundred of miles above earth . the second article is named crash course and it talks how dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other and crashes that create debris . the final section little bits but a big deal talks about space debris present a very serious problem . what all this means is that its organized to deal with separate things that go on in space and how things get there and how it has an effect of other space trips . that is how the article is organized .
25806	9	first off the author makes it sound like it s really exciting so that it makes you want to read the story . then talked about what is space junk and went on from that . told us a little bit about everything people call space junk . like the space capsules telescopes and satellites .
25807	9	he organizes the article in by pollution and the history of the story of space the last frontier . he teaches about everything that you need to know for space .
25808	9	what is space junk crash course little bits but a big deal .
25809	9	the author organizes this article by listing everything in order . they list the events in chronological order . they tell you what happened first then tell you the dangers that effect it .
25810	9	the author organizes the article very well . it is four different sections about important things with space . the article has a lot of good information and facts .
25811	9	many subsections break down the article to a smaller more manageable size and give an easy way for the reader to find specific information
25812	9	he first starts off with a hook to catch the reader s attention and then he starts stating facts and events of satellites that soon became space junk over a period of time . he also gives a story of what happened when a toolbag was lost in space and how dangerous that could be . he finishes with stating that there should be a solution for space pollution .
25813	9	the author organizes the article by putting stuff into different categories of stuff everything the author talks about has a category that it fits best into and they talk about it like they talk about crash course and all it talks about is satellites crashing into one another and deere
25814	9	supports his or her introduction with facts and statement . the author brings history into it and let s us know what has happened and how dangerous it is and how harmful it is .
25815	9	they start it off with something that will get your attention with a popular quote that we have al heard . then they give you a basic definition and history about it and tell you how it started and which countries did . then they explain how it is made or created by telling us that two dead satellites collided and made many many pieces that are still there today . . then in the final section they explain that this is a very serious matter and is not to be taken lightly .
25816	9	the author organizes the article by naming the different topics that he wants to talk about . he tells you about everything that is happening in space . how the trash in space is a bad thing and is not ok .
25817	9	he starts off the article by adding suspense . then dropping to a more calm way . eventually leading to the explanation of space junk .
25818	9	the author organized the arrival by first making a very interesting introduction . then by describing what space junk actually is and how we have had a variety of space junk for over years . in the third paragraph crash course talks to use about how satellites in space and other objects can crash into each other and completely destroy each other . last but not least little bits but a big deal tells us about the danger of what can happen when two objects collide in space .
25819	9	the author organizes the article into multiple sections with their own headline that tells what the writing is going to be about . for example the section crash course explains how there have been many crashes due to the debris floating around in space . the way the author organized the article is helpful to the reader . for example if the reader just wants to know what space junk actually is they can skim the headlines and find something that deals with space junk or if they just want to be informed about what dangers space junk causes they can just read the section little bits but a big deal .
25820	9	the author starts with an introduction and then begins to provide the reader with background information . then the author provides an example of the problem and follows it up with a conclusion that summarizes his point .
25821	9	the author put it in to part and talk about the important ideas of the station in with the article is about . for an example if the title was satellites it would be talking about satellites .
25822	9	the author titles each section with a new name . like what is space junk this section gives a little history of space travel and the debris it is causing . then crash course tells about different satellites crashing and creating more debris in space . finally there is little bits but a big deal which is used to make the reader realize even though the debris can be very small it can cause a lot of damage .
25823	9	the author organize the article by putting interesting information in the introduction then explaining everything about space junk like what is space junk .
25824	9	author used an attention gather in introduction to start the article . it also shows what this article is about . in the body paragraphs he gave us enough information to support the fact .
25825	9	the author organizes this article in different sections they all have there own titles .
25826	9	the author organizes the article into three different topics . in one the author describes what space junk is . in the second part the author tells about how satellites crash into one another . finally in the last part the author describes how dangerous all the tiny particles can truly be to our world . it also describes how harmful the debris can be to spacecraft .
25827	9	by letting the reader know what is going on and how we should understand what is going on and what could happen .
25828	9	the article is organized very prof fe signal and gives a great outline of information to the reader . r
25829	9	the author organized the article by time starting it with the great space invasion . he worked his way from the past to the present . him starting with the great space invasion which started in . then he moved on to dead satellites that crashed into one another in february . then he finished it up with the risk of tiny space debris .
25830	9	the author organizes the article by using startling statements in the beginning to attract the reader s attention . it begins by saying grab your telescope look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor then the article gets more serious and explains the harmful debris in space .
25831	9	he divides it by sections of different topics
25832	9	he organized it very well i think because he put facts about the articles in the right spots . and it all just makes since .
25833	9	he did put history first so you can lean about what has happened and the improvements we have made . such as we where the first on the moon .
25834	9	the author organize the article by talking about the soviet union first and then by talking about the us and russia . as shown in the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite . with no one at the controls dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other . that s exactly what happened in february . two communications satellites one american and one russian both traveling at more than miles per hour crashed into each other miles above the earth . the impact created hundreds of pieces of debris each assuming its own orbital path . now instead of two disabled satellites there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space .
25835	9	he first pulls you in with a good introduction . then he explains what he is going to be talking about . after he gives you that background information he tells you the seriousness of the situation .
25836	9	they but everything in order in which they are going to talk about it . he she put everything into grave detail which was more easy for me to understand as i was read the article .
25837	9	very well . i find it well organized with many good details .
25838	9	he organizes it very simple and and easily .
25839	9	the author organizes this article by explaining what exactly space junk is then giving reasons why it can be very dangerous .
25840	9	tho author organizes the article in different sections or points . the author starts with what is space junk which describes space junk . next comes crash course followed by little bits but a big deal .
25841	9	the author organizes the article by giving the basic information needed to understand the subject first . then by moving on to more serious matters and information . she also organizes the article by topic and by giving each section of topic its own title .
25842	9	the author starts out the article with an introduction to catch your attention . he then tells you about space junk and tells when it began what it is and how it happens . he then goes on to say what happens when they do crash and the after effects . he tells an event that happened like the tool bag that came out of an astronaut s hand and is now traveling through space . he goes on to tell the damage the space junk can do . the author wraps up the article by stating that space junk is a problem .
25843	9	the author starts out play
25844	9	he first tells us that space junk is a problem in our word to this current day and year . then he starts to tell us when it first started that was in when the soviet union launched there first satellite . the united states fallowed right behind them . there they went into space close to each other every day . in the next years there has been more space junk . they have launched tones of different space crafts and some of them have loathsome parts to the ship that they where on . now its at the part were it tells where if the statutes arent working that it causes a major threat to the world . because a dead aircraft or space ship if it hits something that is working there is a po liability that when they hit each other that the working one will shut down because of it being hit and breaking . thus causing them both to hit earth and destroying land or killing some people in the crosses . finally it tells us how to complain how it would effect us on earth . if an aircraft or spaceship would hit something in space it would damage the spacecraft and make more space junk .
25845	9	in a good understandable way .
25846	9	the author organizes the article in a logical way . he begins by making a broad reference to what he is about to discuss . he does this while grabbing the reader s attention with shocking statements and presenting a scenario that the reader can relate to . then he better describes the subject of the criticism and how it came to be . in this section he incorporates background knowledge and historical events that impacted the problem . afterwards he describes the actual problem . then he proceeds to explain why the problem is such a big deal and what is being done to prevent or protect against the problem .
25847	9	the author organizes the article by categorizing more threatening causes of space junk all leading up to the surprisingly big problem . he explains how space junk is caused and how simple yet dangerous it can be .
25848	9	the author organizes the article in a very clear orderly fashion . the article starts off with a catchy introduction . it says grab your telescope look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor it s a . . . tool bag after this the author switches from fun to a more serious tone . he states this space junk is currently of great concern to government space agencies around the globe . after the introduction the author explains what space junk really is . he writes the disabled object becomes a piece of high tech junk circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit . after he explains what it is he goes onto tell what might happen when two satellites collide . he says now instead of two disabled satellites there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space . after this paragraph he goes one to tell us how this debris can affect us . the author states tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft . the author then wraps it all up with his conclusion .
25849	9	micro means small so micro did res means small did res .
25850	9	he talks about space and the astronauts and the space junk how it can fall from space .
25851	9	the author describes what exactly the space junk actually is in this case its satellites and other things including small pieces of the satellites . then follows with the crash course part of the writing that tells how the junk got there including satellite crashes . also the little bits of junk may not seem that there a problem but the little bits but big deal section tells that there is a problem with the little prices of junk to .
25852	9	he organized the article into different sections which he then titled like little bits but a big problem in each of these parts he talked about a different subject that still pertained to the thesis .
25853	9	first the author makes a statement that how once orbital pathways were clear in space but are now filled with space derby . then the author explains to us the history of space and how various amounts of objects have been sent in space or lost in space . new the author states how there is nobody controlling these object that when they are dead or fully used they just roam around in space at highly dangerous speeds and even the littlest of part could cause great damage to objects . now scientists are trying to corporate nations so they can work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution .
25854	9	he starts out with when the first artificial satellite was launched and then about some of the crashes that have happened and finally he talks about random space junk .
25855	9	the author first gains audience attention with a brief summary of the problem of space junk and then in successive groups of paragraphs fleshes out the problem . his first group introduces the subject s history starting with the space race and the first accident . the second group specifically describes the results and likelihood of collisions . the third group describes the impact of microdebris slamming into larger satellites .
25856	9	with one section talking about space junk another defining space junk one talking about satellites one about satellite collisions one about debris another about nasa .
25857	9	they go from some small things to larger trash like satellites . they all talk about how harmful the things are though . they also start with the history of the space races which i think is good right after the intro .
25858	9	this author organizes the article simply introduction to the concept of space junk the great space invasion which ultimately leads to a crash course in space junk and conclusion of the damage that these microdebris can do to the earth or even aircraft that are on their way to explore outer space . the author entices the reader with their opening three exclamations and hooks them on the idea of a tool bag in outer space . then the author adds information about about what space junk actually is before telling the readers of the crash that results in space junk . finally the author writes tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft . if you find that hard to believe compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall . this statement is used to shock the reader into realizing just how dangerous this space junk really is .
25859	9	first he hints that space exploration is a dangerous matter . then he explains why artificial satellites are in space . then lastly he explains in depth to danger of microdebris .
25860	9	he organize it by giving details first
25861	9	the author organizes the article by first introducing the topic of discussion then giving a history of how the space debris got there then explaining how some satellites become smaller and deadlier and lastly by explaining that it is a major problem .
25862	9	the author organizes the article in a topic by topic way . the article is separated into four mini sections . each section has a few paragraphs on a certain topic . for example the section titled what is space junk is all about space junk and what is it . another example is the section titled little bits but a big deal it talks about how even though the materials in space are small they still make a big impact and people care .
25863	9	the author organizes the article by telling us what space junk is then telling us how much of a big deal it is to us and how we can get rid of it .
25864	9	the author organizes the article in a way that emphasizes how space junk can be harmful .
25865	9	the author organizes the arrival with an attention getting statement first and second he goes into detail about how space junk gets into the earth s atmosphere . third he or she explains how the satellites have risks of colliding with each other and what happens to the debris and fourth the author talks about the rates of the tiny debris fragments and about how the scientists are looking for an easy solution to get rid of space junk
25866	9	he talks about the reasons why space junk is dangerous to the atmosphere and the satellites in space causing them to crash eventually due to the difficulty it is to steer clear of the debris .
25867	9	the author organizes the article by using the last sentence of a section to lead into the next section . for example the last sentence of the introduction mentions that the space junk is a great concern around the world then the author continues the next section what is space junk explaining the reason why space junks were created . this section concludes with a sentence saying the disabled satellite objects circled the orbit uncontrolled which leads into the next section where it explains the danger of the dead satellites colliding with each other . this method creates the effect of questioning and answering which allows the reader to absorb the complex information slowly and thoroughly .
25868	9	the author organizes the article into subsections that operate both in the general context of the article and under their own headings . these sections are organized so that the reader learns more about space junk its history and the dangers it presents in a logical order . the author starts with defining space junk and progresses to the final heading little bits but a big deal which ultimately states that the author s true purpose in writing this article is to illustrate to the reader how big a problem space junk is for the world .
25869	9	how the orbiting junk get into slave . he first started off the article with something that will grab reads thought s . second he talks about the crash course on what the harmful things out are space are . there thing the author talk s about is little bits but a big deal it talks about how the it increased more about what we know about space . in conclusion he is doing the right thing about space and how fun it is to float around in the space shuttle .
25870	9	the author organize the space junk of the concern to the government space agencies around the globe .
25871	9	the author organizes the article by putting each thing in its own category . for example little bits but a big deal is about sat lies crashing .
25872	9	he gets your attention than expresses the importance of space junk than he tells you what space junk is he tells you about what space junk has done in the past and lastly he stresses again that space junk is a big deal .
25873	9	he mainly just puts it together very nice and is comfortable with writing what he s got or what he has .
25874	9	the author organizes the article by first starting off with little questions or sayings . then moving onto important facts about space life and when things have happened . the author gives dates of different things and also gives reasons behind why he is talking about that certain topic at that given moment . the author also organized the article by crash courses . next with little bits but a big deal . he talks about a lot but separated each topic .
25875	9	he arranges it in an order that makes more sense as you read further . he starts off with the history of space exploration . then it goes into problems that can occur .
25876	9	the author organizes this story with the problem more stuff wrong with space travel then a solution to the problem then goes back to some more problems then sums it up with what we could do to help .
25877	9	the author organizes his article very well . he first grabs your attention with exciting exclamations and tells what his article will mostly talk about . he then explains in depth the subject of his article space junk . after he explains this he talks about how the space junk ended up where it is . finally he talks about how big of an impact this space junk creates and who is responsible for this .
25878	9	the author organized the work into sub categories with their own titles . for example what is space junk and crash course . these headings where very helpful the the organization of the long article .
25879	9	the author organizes his article by putting it in paragraph structure
25880	9	the author organizes the article with headings within the article and in the sections of the headings explains what the heading is talking about .
25881	9	in the introduction the author talks about looking into the a night sky to see things in space while doing so they see a tool bag . the tool bag is used to talk about what the author calls space junk . as the story goes on the author talks about what space junk really is then goes on to talk about that it can cause crashes and then on to the sizes of debris .
25882	9	the author uses a title for each segment . flowing the reader stay on track .
25883	9	the author organizes the article by introducing us to the topic and then using three different sections to give us information about space junk . the introduction includes the author s thesis and then he expands on it in the next three sections . the what is space junk section gives us details on what space junk really is and how it comes about . the crash course section talks about the dangers of dead satellites colliding in orbit by providing us with an example of a russian and american satellite colliding in . the little bits but a big deal section is providing us information on why space junk is actually a serious problem because of the damage it can inflict . the author organizes the information in a way that readers can understand and really learn about the impact space junk has .
25884	9	the author organizes in the article by giving headings for each sections . for example what is space junk provides us clues that that section is going to explain to the reader what space junk is . crash course is going to tell us how satellites sometimes collide with other satellites in space and so on .
25885	9	the author tells of the dangers and of the power of the small space junk has like the tool bag it can be very dangerous do to the power and force that its orbiting with
25886	9	the author first tries to get your attention by using examination . then the author tells about facts about dangers in space .
25887	9	he organize the article to show us how everything works how he starts out by using orbiting junk to get us to see what its mainly bout then he takes us on dealt to let us know why hes telling us then . then he goes onto explaining why this stuff happens what it does to the space ships and letting us know why we should care .
25888	9	the author started the article off with what the space junk is before telling people how it is a problem . he wanted people to know what it was so that they knew what he was talking about . if the readers knew what he was talking about then they would see how its a problem in space and how it is not good for space .
25889	9	by introducing a problem and then giving evidence on it and true statements .
25890	9	the author grabs the readers attention at first . then they go into conclusion about what space junk is and describing it . after that the author talks about a crash course that happened in the past . the author then talks about how a little bit of space junk is a big deal . since you already know about space junk you know it can be a big deal . he then finishes it off by stating that hopefully america and other countries can get together and help solve the problem of so much space junk in the air .
25891	9	the author organize the article by putting everything in the order . talk about what is space junk .
25892	9	the author organizes it by saying what normal people would say . because a lot of people don t know anything about space . he tells us what it really is . he goes into telling what space junk is . and how it effects the satellites the risk of colliding into each other . he changes the tone after the introduction to really tell us that it s a big deal .
25893	9	the author organized the article in a way that would catch the reads attention the slowly work its way into the more serious matter for example the dangerous of space junk and the damage that it can cause to our space shuttles and our planet . it was planned out well most people don t want to read about space nor do they care but the author wrote this in a manner that was respectable and peculiar . they did not blame anyone the early just believe that this is a serious manner that needs to be resolved somehow before it becomes a deadly problem to astronauts . in fact the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration the author at this point has a forewarning tone she isn t condoning this but they would much enjoy if everyone found a way to find a solution to the problem .
25894	9	the author starts off with a introduction then moves on and talks about space junk . after that he goes from topic to topic .
25895	9	the author organizes the article in sections like chapters to get the full details of the story . the sections are headed with a main detail to inform you whats coming up in the section .
25896	9	the author organizes this article with an introduction his main body paragraphs with his main topics and finally a conclusion . just like a five paragraph essay .
25897	9	the author organizes the article using sub headings . what is space junk crash course little bits but a big deal
25898	9	the author organizes it in sections to make it easier to follow and understand the importance of space junk . you learn in the first section that satellites can be shut down . you also learn that accidents happen in space .
25899	9	the author organizes the article by sections that lead into each other .
25900	9	the author organizes the article by strategically ordering the topics he talks about in order of importance .
25901	9	the author gets your attention first then gets to the facts then the importance of the space junk . he wants to get you pulled in so that you can get excited and want to know more about it . the author brings up the history of the things that happened to let you know that this could happen again easily .
25902	9	the author first explains what space junk is and then goes on to write about some of the space junk that has existed . he tells about how dangerous and can be and are making people aware of it . this bits of space debris present a very serious problem says the writer trying to emphasize how it can be dangerous .
25903	9	the author organizes the article by describing every detail of space junk possible . he she begins by explaining what space junk is . then the author gives possible problems and outcomes . lastly the author describes why space junk is a big deal and very dangerous .
25904	9	the author organizes his article very well i think . i think that the author has every bit of information in perfect order . he has very many facts to back up his information he explains how loose tools in space would effect space crafts and people on earth . i think that the author supports his article greatly .
25905	9	the author organized his information by how much certain pieces of it relate with other pieces of information . such as you wouldn t find any information that defines space junk in the paragraph entitled crash course .
25906	9	the author talks about what it is . then he gives a description of space junk . then the author talks about the crash course and how you cant control a satellite or anything like that from running into space deere . then the author talks about how the littlest particle of space deere can be very dangerous if it gets up to speed and hits another object at a fast speed .
25907	9	the author organizes the article into sections about different details about space junk . each section contains different details and information about the space junk . first in what is space junk the author explains what space junk really is . they give information about how some of the junk can circle the world for indefinitely how some of it will never ever go away and can cause harm and problems . second in the section crash course the author explains how objects up in space can crash into one another and can cause many problems . even a simple tool bag lost in space could have a harmful effect . lastly in little bits but a big deal they tell how many people actual care how much space trash there is . some of the effects of the space junk can cause just as much damage as a sand blaster to a painted concrete wall .
25908	9	the author organized the article very well the entire article was very organized .
25909	9	the author organizes the article by first telling us about space junk and what it is . then goes into crash course telling us about what happen with a crash course . finally the author talks little bits but a big deal . little bits but big deal cause a disastrous hole in an object moving in space .
25910	9	the author organizes this article by putting the historical information first . he she lets us know when space satellites were first put into space and what has happened since then with the explorations . then the author goes on to explain what happens to all the clutter left behind in the explorations themselves like the two communication satellites crashing and the tool bag that was lost by an astronauts doing repairs . finally the author lets us know that many people do care about the debris and that nasa and the european space agency has found a way to tell just how big some of the debris is . although they can t see things smaller than a baseball they can tell that the space trash amount is increasing .
25911	9	the author organizes the article by first using a hook a well known phrase to catch the readers attention . after that they use explanations interesting facts and a summary of the problem and a possible solutions .
25912	9	by
25913	9	the author begins the article with a simple tone which leads into a more serious yet informational tone .
25914	9	the order of the article is arranged in a very organized way first the author grabs the reader s attention by making the subject interesting with reader interaction . then the problem is brought up and explained first by defining what the problem is and why it is a problem . finally the article is concluded with a statement of an idea on how to illuminate the problem .
25915	9	the author starts the article out by saying it s a comet it s a meteor it s a . . . tool bag which then leads into talking about space junk . then the author talks about some history of spacecrafts and other objects . the author then talks about different crashes having to do with satellites . finally the author goes on to talk about tiny fragments can be dangerous .
25916	9	the author of the article orbiting junk organizes the article in a specific way . the author first starts out by gaining the reader s attention by using shocking statements . the first sentence grab your telescope look up in the sky it s a comet its a meteor is used to make the reader think something bad is about to happen . the reader might think that a meteor is crashing down to earth or that something else dangerous might happen . after gaining the reader s attention the author then goes on to say that it is nothing more that a tool bag . the reader most likely now thinks that the beginning narrator is not actually looking up into space when they actually are . the reader is probably now curious as to what the beginning narrator is looking at . the author now explains that what the narrator is seeing is space junk . this paragraph explaining that the beginning narrator is seeing space junk is enticing the reader into wanting to read more . in the next section labeled what is space junk is used to explain exactly what space junk is . the author uses these paragraphs to explain that space junk can be just about anything . in the section crash course the author uses actual events that have occurred to explain to the reader that even malfunctioning satellites can become space junk if they completely quit working or if they are unable to be controlled by people on earth anymore . in the final section of the article little bits but a big deal the author summarizes that all the different pieces of space junk can be as large as a satellite to smaller than a baseball . the author explains that objects smaller than a baseball are unable to be detected and because of this the space ships that orbit into space have to have more layers of walls and protection to protect them from the microdebris . this article is organized in a way to help the reader understand all that they can about what space junk is and what problems it may cause . the author has a very efficient way of organizing the article and the article is easy to understand .
25917	9	the author organizes his article into sections starting with an introduction . then the author moves into the main points of what he is trying to get across to the reader . first he talks about the history of satellites in what is space junk . in crash course he talks about how satellites collide . then in the last section little bits but a big deal he talks about what to do as a solution to this harmful problem .
25918	9	with facts first .
25919	9	the author organized the article to catch the readers eye at the start and then to inform them of the pollution of the space today . he organized it that each paragraph had its on kind of information also titled them so that the information that the reader was looking for could be found easily .
25920	9	the author organized the article into main sections . each section discusses a particular part of space junk . these sections include what it is how it got there and why is it important . he supported these with facts and examples .
25921	9	he puts it in to categories and explains them
25922	9	this article is organized differently then most . it starts with somewhat of a dialogue then turns into facts . it asks questions then defines the answers well .
25923	9	he organized it in paragraph form which is put into parts to give you reasons to believe that space junk is dangerous to the space shuttles .
25924	9	the author made it so that the more important details where at the beginning the the end of the article . by doing so he was able to keep the readers attention for the entire time they were reading it . making it so that the reader wants to read it is most likely to be one of the hardest thing that the author had to do . in the begging he tells about what happened to the satellites and at the end he tells about how the degree is a major factor in space .
25925	9	the author gives a problem then explains it . they then explain what causes the problem and what effects it has . then they give solutions to the problem along with other details .
25926	9	badly cause they just kinda jump around and dont get right to the point
25927	9	the author organized the article in a flowing order to make the reader better able to understand what he she is reading . the author starts by explain what started creating space junk to appear outside earth s atmosphere then went on to how things can go into their own orbit and that increasing space research is only making the matter of space junk worse .
25928	9	the author organizes the article by importance . they had the attention letter first . after the attention letter they explained what space junk is . then they stated more startling statistics about space crashes . lastly they explained how space junk compares to other things and emphasizes how dangerous it is .
25929	9	the author organizes the article by getting the reader interested in the article and then by showing the reader that space junk is bad and that it can damage the earth every time the space junk crashes into the earth . according to paragraph ten it states scientist are hard pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk paragraph . this states that it is a hard time to keep it safe .
25930	9	the author explains that and how space junk is a serious matter no matter what size it is .
25931	9	the author organized this article into questions the reader may have about space exploration . the author then gives a short incident that relates to that question and explains .
25932	9	the author start by grabbing the readers attention . they then go on to explain what space junk actually is and after this they explain some situations in which the debris is created with the section entitled crash course . the last but certainly not least movement that the author makes toward organization is to explain what the importance and seriousness of space junk . the author certainly emphasizes the danger that astronauts face when they are sent on missions in the last section .
25933	9	the author starts you calm and fun but then he goes in to easily a list of what he she is talking about . he she goes into asking what is space junk . tells you facts and keeps in interesting then moves on to more topic that has the same feel to it .
25934	9	the author organizes the article by first explaining what space junk is . when the author gave the reader information about space junk he explained the many ways that the junk may get into space . last the author informs the reader that the little bits of space junk floating around can actually cause major damage .
25935	9	they begin by telling about how space junk has cluttered up orbital pathways and how they are dangerous and then they provided examples of things that has happened to show that space junk is dangerous and finally talks about how the issue is becoming a bigger concern every day with more space junk piling up into the orbital pathway .
25936	9	they organize it in a very clean cut way . they have everything in order so it is easy to read and flows very good .
25937	9	he tells the story in order
25938	9	the author goes from the first satellite . then begins to tell us that it is dangerous if satellites crash into each other . finally the author begins to say how bad it is if the satellites crash into each other .
25939	9	the author organizes the article into four organized sections . the first section is titled orbiting junk and this is the introductory paragraph that overviews the entire writing piece . the next section introduces the history of space and how the space junk appeared there . the third section is titled crash course and this tells actual facts about a time when two satellites actually crashed while in orbit . this helps give more statistics about the writing . the last section called little bits but a big deal explains how this problem affects us and how we can help .
25940	9	the article states that the soviet union was the first to send a satellite in to space . and then it talks about other satellites going in to space .
25941	9	the author organized the article in order of the old things first then going into the future . under what is space junk is and goes over the next years . crash course is the now and little bits but a big deal is the future . that is how the author organized the article .
25942	9	the author sections his article from his main idea of space junk and then condenses it down to the composing elements such as little bits but a big deal and explains all of the smaller contributions to the bigger problem . also he sections off the effects of space junk in the section titled crash course .
25943	9	the author organizes the article in an efficient orderly and easy to read manner . the author created different sections with different titles such as what is space junk and crash course . each different section discusses a certain topic . for example what is space junk discusses how research satellites can become debris in space . these multiple sections help the reader to focus on a certain topic at a time . in addition because all of the sections are in a logical order they give the reader an easier transition into the next topic . for example a reader who is reading this article would first be wondering about space junk and then how it is made . in the article the author first discusses what space junk is and then discusses in the section crash course how it is made .
25944	9	the author organizes the article in a way to inform people . he she describes space junk in order for people reading this to understand what is being talked about . the author then uses specific dates to show the severity of the problem .
25945	9	it tells you about how the space junk got there and how it gets out of space and it talks about how crash course and it talks about little bits but a big deal who they all get in to space .
25946	9	he organizes it by talking about space and the satellites . then he talks about how satellites have crashed into each other creating space junk . and it talks about how these small pieces of junk are a huge deal because some satellites can pick them up on the radar and how the pieces of junk travel very fast through space and can do lot of damage .
25947	9	he organizes this story but catching your eye at first . then he tells you about the history of that . then finding out facts of them .
25948	9	the author organizes the arrival by using supporting details events that have occurred thing that might happen and history on space .
28135	10	light gray that color will keep the doghouse cool when its hot but not too cold that it would be uncomfortable for the dog . i believe this because the light gray has an average temperature of 45 deg c . the white is three degrees lower than that the dark gray was three degrees above light gray and black was another five degrees above that .
28136	10	black black is more attractive to the sun and it make more things warmer or hotter
28137	10	light gray i picked light gray because its not to hot of a color and not to cold of a color
28138	10	white it will keep it cooler inside because white reflects heat which means it wouldnt be entering the house .
28139	10	light gray painting the doghouse light gray will affect th temp . by making it warm . not too cool and not too hot . for example in the results light gray was 45 deg c while black was 53 deg c and white was 42 deg c .
28140	10	white it should reflect more thermal energy because the higher flow resent look while black is dark and absorbs more thermal energy
28141	10	white that color would keep the doghouse colder than the other ones . white reflects light and darker colors absorb the heat .
28142	10	black the black will create more energy in the doghouse for more air temperature .
28143	10	light gray light gray will affect the doghouse by keeping it warm because light gray is does not absorb a lot of energy but it absolves enough energy to keep the doghouse warm .
28144	10	dark gray i chose dark gray for the color the doghouse should be painted because doghouses are used to keep the dog warm at night or for shade on a hot day and the color is even on both . for example it cold outside 24 deg c and the dog goes inside the doghouse which is about 48 deg the dog is better of in the doghouse .
28145	10	black if you painted a doghouse black then if the sun was out the doghouse will be warmer than it would be if it was any other color . during the glass jar experiment black had a average temperature of 53 deg which was 5 deg higher than the second hottest color .
28146	10	white the white color absorbs less heat from the sun than black color . this will help the dog keep cool and fresh . the dog will not be hot if the color is white . the average of the white color is 4 2 deg c . the average of black is 53 deg c . so what color is the coolest the answer is white .
28147	10	black if they use black paint for their doghouse then heat with stay in because black absorbs heat .
28148	10	white the color white would make the doghouse very cool because it said in the passage that the darker the color the hotter it gets because it absorbs the energy . so by choosing white i think the dog and the dogs house will be alto cooler
28149	10	white this color would keep the doghouse cooler because in the experiment the white lids heat had an average of 42 deg c and the black lid had an average of 53 deg c . the white lid was 11 deg cooler than the black lid .
28150	10	black you should use black because that attracts the most heat and can bethe warmest temperature for the dog .
28151	10	black the color black might affect the doghouse by the temperature staying at a comfortable level so its not too hot and not too cold just like in the experiment how the dark black lid stayed on average a comfortable 53 deg .
28152	10	white white is the best choice because according to the table it attracts the least amount of heat therefore it is the best option .
28153	10	dark gray in the winter it well deep the doghouse warm but not so much that the dog gets heatstroke in the summer .
28154	10	white if you paint the doghouse white then your dog will stay much cooler on hot days because white reflects heat away .
28155	10	light gray this way the doghouse doesnt get too hot from the sun because you can see from brandi and jerry s experiment that having a dark colored doghouse could make it too hot for the dog but having it completely white might make it too cold . this is because dark colors absorb more light .
28156	10	white i would choose white because it reflects the sun and back makes it hotter .
28157	10	black the black would make the doghouse warmer inside for the doggy .
28158	10	white white will make the doghouse cooler . like in the lid color vs . air temperature inside glass jar experiment . the white lid had a cooler temperature compared to black dark gray and light gray .
28159	10	white the white color will reflect most of the radiation waves so that it will be cooler in the doghouse .
28160	10	black black paint color is 53 degrees and white paint color is 42 degrees that 11 degrees warmer than white
28161	10	dark gray it will make the doghouse warm
28162	10	white the color white might effect the doghouse by since color white is not a dark color it doesnt absorb as much heat as dark colors do so the doghouse could be cooler by adding a lighter color to the doghouse .
28163	10	light gray
28164	10	light gray because if color is dark it is gonna have more temperature but if color is light it is gonna have less temperature .
28165	10	black there will be more light inside of the dog house and more heat .
28166	10	white you wouldnt wanna use a dark color for the dog house because the darker the color the more the color absorbed energy from the sun causing the inside of the doghouse to get hotter thus inca using the dog to overheat . not a good thing fora dog . after the him ins of testing each color of lid white had an average temperature of 42 deg c and black had an average temp enure of 53 deg c . white had 11 deg c less then black did
28167	10	white i chose white because the color reflects the most amount of heat data from the table shows that the darker the color the hotter the temperature the color collects . therefore the doghouse should be alight color .
28168	10	dark gray i think that dark gray would bethe best choice i think this because dark gray will allow for some warm air to enter on a cold day . also on a hot day it will not absorb to much heat for the house to overheat . days that supports this is in the experiment blacks te future increased the most starting at 24 deg c and rising to 53 deg c . when the white only rose to 42 deg c starting also at 24 deg c . when dark gray was somewhat in the middle with 48 deg c starting at 24 deg c .
28169	10	light gray it well affect a lie bit . because it light gray .
28170	10	white it will make the inside of the doghouse cooler because the average temperature was 42 deg c and black which is the darkest color was on average 53 deg c .
28171	10	white when summer comes the dog will be nice and cool inside the doghouse with the sun hitting the doghouse because the white paint wont attract the heat as much as black paint would . so the dog will be nice and cool instead of hot and sad .
28172	10	white this color white may affect the doghouse with heat . the white keeps the room cool because its not a dark color like black so it doesnt attract the sun and heat so much . if you were to use the table in the experiment as a reference you would see that white keeps the jar the coolest out of all the colors .
28173	10	white if you choose the color white fora doghouse then according to the glass jar data the doghouse would be cooler then if it was a black doghouse .
28174	10	white white might affect the doghouse because it wont attract as much heat the average is 42 deg c
28175	10	light gray the color of the doghouse is dependant on the climate in which the dog is living . for instance a black dog house is best suited to a cold climate like alaska where it would help to keep the doghouse warm during the cold winter . but if you live ina warm climate like san diego the best color for the doghouse would be white . the white would help to reflect the heat keeping the dog cool during the hot summer . if the dog lived in northwestern washington i would say the best color for the doghouse is light gray . the light gray would keep the dog warmer in the the winter than the white . the data provided shows that the light gray is on average 3 deg warmer thant he white . but would allow the dog to be cool enough in the summer as the light gray is on average 3 deg cooler than the dark gray and 7 deg c color than the black . if i had to choose a color for the doghouse i would choose light gray as it would work best for the area in which i live . this question was written poorly because there isnt a definite answer and therefore is a matter of opinion . more information should be given in the question to help the student make the correct choice .
28176	10	light gray light grey is about good temperature fora dog ina doghouse . warm . the table says that light grey and dark grey are between white and black so i chose something in the middle .
28177	10	white the color white would affect the inside of the doghouse by keeping it cool . in the experiment the white lid color had an average of 42 deg c while black had an average of 53 deg c . that s a difference of 11 deg . a doghouse that s white should keep the dog nice and cool in the summer .
28178	10	light gray light gray will attract a little light but not to much . black would attract a lot of heat and that wouldnt be good so would dark gray but light gray wouldnt attract as much and white wouldn t really attract any heat .
28179	10	white white is the best color to paint the dog house because white absorbed the least amount of heat .
28180	10	white i would use white for the doghouse roof because it would keep the doghouse cooler inside for the dog . in the experiment when a white lid was used its average change in temperature was 11 deg c less than the average temperature change using the black lid concluding that a lighter colored roof will keep the doghouse cooler .
28181	10	white white would bethe best paint color because on a sunny hot day it would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler than a darker colored doghouse . this can be proven because in the experiment the black lid had an average inside temperature of 53 deg c and the white lid had an average inside temperature of 42 deg c . therefore a white doghouse would be 11 deg c cooler than the black doghouse .
28182	10	white if we paint the dogs house white then it would get more cooler because white mostly attract about c .
28183	10	white this color will affect the doghouse by decreasing the temperature heat and it will actually cause the doghouse to be more cooler .
28184	10	dark gray suck it
28185	10	white this will effect the doghouse because the lighter the color the less attracted toby the sun or heat source . results from the text say the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid was 42 deg c and the starting temperature was 24 deg c .
28186	10	black it is the darkest
28187	10	white the color i chose may effect the doghouse because different colors react differently in certain temperatures for example white absorbs it .
28188	10	white the color will affect the doghouse temperature because if you paint a doghouse black it would make it all hot inside . but if you paint it white it will stay cool and moist .
28189	10	black this color would affect threat in the dog house because black attract heat . this you should use if the dog needs tow arm because the average temp was c c more than the last one
28190	10	white white would reflect the heat and the dog house would be cooler
28191	10	black this color of the doghouse might make it to hot for the dog . the average of the black is 53 degrees and the average for the white is 42 degrees .
28192	10	black the color is really dark and can get it to be really hot inside and the dog might die if there is no fresh cold air .
28193	10	light gray i chose light gray and it might effect the dog house by keeping the doghouse not to hot and not to cold because it is the color with the medium amount of heat
28194	10	dark gray it wont make it too hot or too cold it will be just right
28195	10	white the color affects the outhouse in that the lighter the color the cooler it stays . which is good because dogs cant overheat and the darker it is the hotter it gets inside .
28196	10	white the paint color white will make the inside of the doghouse the least hot because based on the results white had the lowest air temperature if they use white the inside wont get too hot
28197	10	white painting a doghouse white would keep the insides of the doghouse cooler than other color would .
28198	10	white i would choose white so the doghouse does not get to hot inside . black would heat the doghouse to much .
28199	10	dark gray it will keep the same temp because in the data table it says 48 for trial 1 48 for trial 2 48 for trial 3 and as one can see 48 will obviously bethe average
28200	10	black the black paint will keep to warm inside the doghouse to keep the dog warm .
28201	10	white brandi and jerry might want to color the doghouse white because the data shows that the average temperature 42 deg c after 10 minutes will keep the dog the coolest inside a white colored doghouse .
28202	10	white the house will beat the coldest temperature that it can be out of all the other colors .
28203	10	white that color will make the doghouse cooler because they was studying to find out if dark colors change the temp and the white is the cooler on with all the trials they did .
28204	10	white the color will either make it hotter or colder inside the doghouse this is why i would choose white to paint the doghouse because in the experiment it created the lowest temperatures in the jar .
28205	10	white if the color was darker the air inside would get hotter than if the color was lighter . according to the data from the experiment the darker colors heated up more than the lighter colors
28206	10	black i choose the color black for it will make the doghouse warmer to live in . for the hot lamp experiment showed that the darker the lid color the warmer the air is inside . for when the lid was black it had an average of 53 deg c and when the lid was white it had an average temperature of 42 deg . with a difference of 11 deg .
28207	10	white white would bethe best color because on a hot summers day the inside of a white doghouse would not be nearly as hot as the inside of a black or dark gray or even alight gray doghouse . and the color white absorbs the least heat than all of the other colors do so white would be your best bet fora nice cool doghouse .
28208	10	black black would bethe best color because the darker the color the more energy it absorbed so the doghouse will be warmer and heated .
28209	10	white white doesnt attract as much light energy as darker colors would .
28210	10	light gray how this color might affect the doghouse is because it isnt too hot or cold it is the coolest one the average is 45 deg c . and the black one is 53 deg c and white is 42 deg c .
28211	10	white in the experiment white was the least hot so i would use whit to keep te dog nice and cool and by using white u will be able to seethe doghouse in the nite witch give ran into mine at nite it sucks
28212	10	black painting the doghouse black would make it warmer for the dog .
28213	10	black if brandi and jerry live ina colder climate i would recommend them painting the house black because as you can tell by the experiment results the darker the color the warmer it will be inside .
28214	10	white that is going to make it hot in the for the dog .
28215	10	dark gray it would keep the doghouse at a warm tempt re not to hot or not to cold .
28216	10	dark gray dark grey would keep the doghouse warmer in the cold weather because due to the test results it was warmer than inside the white doghouse . in the summer when its hot dark grey wouldnt be too hot for the dog unlike the color black which would have kept the doghouse warmer than it needed to be in the summertime .
28217	10	white if the doghouse was a dark color dark gray or black the it would be very hot in there . if it was light gray or white it would be perfect temperature .
28218	10	black using black paint to paint the doghouse would bethe best because it would absorb the most heat so it would keep the dog the warmest . i know this because in the results from the experiment in trial 1 the air inside the jar with the black lid had a temperature of 54 deg c after 10 minutes . the jar with the dark grey lid had a temperature of 48 deg c after 10 minutes . the jar with the light gray lid had a temperature of 44 deg c after 10 minutes . and the jar with the white lid had a temperature of 42 deg c after 10 minutes . so this resulting data proves that black absorbs the most heat so that should bethe color to paint the doghouse so that the dog is warmer . because if it made the inside of ajar warmer it will most likely make the inside of a doghouse warmer .
28219	10	white this color cannot make it so hot in the summer so the dog can rest inside of it . as shown in the experiment the white color was the least hottest temperature .
28220	10	black black would attract more energy
28221	10	white brandi and jerry should use white paint to color the doghouse . in the experiment the results showed that white paint has the lowest average temperature at 42 deg c the black had 53 deg c the dark gray had 48 deg c and light gray had 45 deg c . this proves that white color will have the lowest temperature in the doghouse .
28222	10	dark gray black would bethe best paint color for the doghouse because it will absorb the most heat and keep the doghouse warm .
28223	10	dark gray dark grey will keep the doghouse warm in the winter and cooler then black in the summer . the black as shown in theta be was definitely the warmest with an average temperature of 53 deg c . dark grey had an average of 48 deg c light grey had 45 deg c and white was only 42 deg c . with a range of 42 53 i believe that dark grey being somewhere in the middle was a good choice for all seasons .
28224	10	white because it reflects the suns radiation unlike all the others that attract the suns radiation
28225	10	dark gray well for 1 . what type of dog is it . 2 . depending on the type of year it is .
28226	10	dark gray keeps it warmer then light gray or white for the winter but keeps it cooler then black for the summer
28227	10	dark gray they might want to use the dark gray paint because when the sun hits it it wont get to hot and when there is not sun it wont get to cold . i discovered this by looking at the results of the experiment and they show that after ten minutes of the light hitting the dark gray it was about 48 deg c and the temp stayed consistent throughout the trials .
28228	10	black this color might affect the doghouse by making it former because the darker the color the former the doghouse will be .
28229	10	white the color white would effect the doghouse because the temperature would stay cooler when the sun is out because white doesnt absorb as much energy than darker colors do . that way the dog wouldn t overheat . this is proved in the experiment because the white lid caused the air to have an average temperature of 42 deg c which was the coolest temperature . black which was the darkest color made the air have an average temperature of 53 deg c .
28230	10	white white would bring the doghouse cooler . this is shown by the results in the past experiment . with the white colored lid on the jar being the coldest temperature .
28231	10	white it will be cooler in the summer but still war min the winter the average temp were was deg c
28232	10	white if you were to paint the doghouse white it would be cool inside in the summer because white reflects heat energy more than light gray dark gray and black black absorbs heat energy .
28233	10	black black would affect he inside of the doghouse because dark colors absorb heat and black would increase the indoor temperature .
28234	10	dark gray dark gray would affect the temperature inside of the doghouse by making it a little warmer but not to hot . in the experiment to see if the color affected the temperature black was the hottest . white was the coolest . i picked dark gray because it stayed 48 deg the whole time and would not be to hot or to cold .
28235	10	dark gray i choose dark grey because it will keep the dog house warm in winter . but cool in the summer .
28236	10	white i think that white would bethe best color to paint the doghouse . white would bethe best because it stays the coolest . in the investigation the lid color that stayed the coldest was the white lid . the average temperature for the white lid was 42 deg c . while the others were 53 deg c for black 48 deg c for dark gray and 45 deg c for light gray . if i were the dog i would want a nice cool house because i wouldnt want to feel all hot and stuffy .
28237	10	white black because the doghouse would catch on fire .
28238	10	black it might keep the doghouse warm at night
28239	10	white the white paint on a doghouse would ensure that the doghouse would never be to hot fora dog to safely live within it . in this experiment brandi and jerry put different colored lids on glass jars filled with air that was at the start of the experiment at 24 deg c . they then heated 4 jars with different colored lids under a hot lamp to see which color black dark gray light gray or white would effect t the air temperature within the jar the most . after three trials on each of the four jars brandi and jerry averaged the temperatures for each jar after being heated . black the hottest color on average rose 30 deg c after ten minutes while white only rose an average of 18 deg . so if brandi and jerry were also building a doghouse then they would want to paint it white because the temperature of the air within would not become dangerous in the summer months when the ambient temperature becomes higher .
28240	10	white it wouldnt be to hot fora dog
28241	10	white i would paint the doghouse white because it would keep the dog cool when its hot outside i know this because in the data table white was the coldest color
28242	10	white the color might affect the doghouse because the average of the white color is 42 and it will not keep it warm inside the doghouse . and the others colors temperature average is 45 48 .
28243	10	white white has an average temperature of 42 which will make it much more cooler in the doghouse than any of the other dark colors who temperature is 45 or higher according to the data table
28244	10	white the color of the doghouse should be white because it would be cooler inside the doghouse around 42 deg c . if it was a darker color it would be warmer in the doghouse around 53 deg c .
28245	10	dark gray it will affect the doghouse because dark colors absorb heat so if the dog gets cold it would have heat also when it dirty you still can see it so it will be clean
28246	10	dark gray i think that the dark gray doghouse is the best color because in the winter it will be warm in sid and in the summer it will be cold outside because its average temperature is sorta in them middle 48 deg of all the average temperatures .
28247	10	white white would bethe best color because in the experiment black had an average temperature of 53 deg c dark gray had an average of 48 deg c light gray had an average of 45 deg c and white had an average of 42 deg c . white had a difference of 11 deg c from black making it abetter choice to keep a doghouse cool .
28248	10	white white will make the doghouse cooler because white had the least average heat
28249	10	white because more air can get inside the doghouse 
28250	10	white you would want a lighter color like white so that not as much heat gets trapped in the doghouse cooking your dog .
28251	10	dark gray i think the dark grey would effect the dog house the most because it would always give the dog shade and it wouldnt be to bright in the morning or the day that way the dog could sleep whenever it wanted .
28252	10	light gray that color would keep the doghouse cool but not freezing and not so hot that the dog would be panting either . in the results it said that the high temperature was 53 deg c and the low was 4 2 deg c . 53 deg would be very hot in the summer and 42 deg would be very cold in the winter . so 45 deg would keep it mostly the same all through out the year .
28253	10	dark gray i chose dark gray because in summer it would not be as hot as black and in winter it would not be to cold as white or light gray
28254	10	black i chose this because it got a higher average than the other houses .
28255	10	black if they use black it will keep the dog warm in winter and summer . black absorbs heat so inside the doghouse will be warm if the doghouse color was light gray the average temperature would be around 45 deg c but that with ajar and white would be 42 deg c and with black it be 53 deg c so it will be even warmer ina doghouse .
28256	10	black it will absorb sunlight and heat up the doghouse 
28257	10	white white will affect the doghouse because lighter colors dont attract sunlight that much like black does so white would make the doghouse stay cooler .
28258	10	white whit would probably make the air inside the jar cooler than it would be if i was back or any other dark color .
28259	10	white the white pant will not absorb as much heat so inside the doghouse will be cooler . as you can see from the data black absorbed the most heat with the average temperature of 53 deg c while the white paint made the air in the jar rise to an average of 42 deg c .
28260	10	dark gray i think the best color for the doghouse would be dark gray because dark gray will not make the air temperature raise as much as the some of the other colors but it also wont make it too cold for the dog . the average test results for dark gray was 48 deg c where the black was at 53 deg c which was the highest . the lowest was the white and that was at 42 deg c . so the dark gray is about in the middle of the highest and lowest results so it should be just about perfect temperature for the dog .
28261	10	black black would help keep the doghouse warm because after sitting ina jar for ten minutes the black lid had the highest average temperature .
28262	10	black black paint will affect the doghouse because when it is hot outside the inside will be extremely hot . in the data table the average for black paint is 53 deg c compared to the average of white paint 42 deg c . meaning the darker the color the more heat .
28263	10	white if brandi and jerry live ina hotter environment then white would bethe best choice for comfort because lighter colors attract more heat . if it is colder then they should go with black fort he doghouse color because black absorbs more energy .
28264	10	white it would make the doghouse cooler because white deflects more heat making it cooler and black attract more heat making it hotter
28265	10	white i think they should use white for the dog house because the darker the color of the lid in the experiment the hotter the air was in the jar . data for white was 42 deg and the data for black w as deg so its a significant difference in the temp so they should use white so the dog wont be as hot in his doghouse .
28266	10	white white is a color that reflects all colors so in that case making it cooler and black and dark grey and light grey will attract the sun and other colors .
28267	10	white it could effect it by if the color was dark then it would absorb more energy . if it is light is light then it wont absorb a lot energy .
28268	10	white white because white has the less temperature so that means the paint will last longer then having black dark grey or light grey . if you ended up having that the paint would last as long as the white paint .
28269	10	white i choose white because according to the data table white absorbed the least amount of heat compared to the other colored lids . also the dog will most likely be hot so you want a color that wont make the doghouse hot .
28270	10	dark gray painting the doghouse dark gray affects the doghouse and the dog living it in . with white paint the doghouse will have a temperature of about 42 deg c . with a temperature of 42 deg c the dog my get too cold but black paint creates a temperature of about 54 deg c which may cause the dog to get too warm . dark gray makes a temperature of about 48 deg c that isnt too warm or too cold .
28271	10	dark gray well the color dark grey would help the dog keep warm and not cold in the doghouse . and it will also be a nice color and the dog will most likely like the doghouse if its not too hot for him or to cold .
28272	10	light gray the light grey would make it not too hot but also not to cold so you can cool down easy but not stay to cold like if the sun is shining on a black house you aunt going to get very cool in your house but if its light grey or grey then you have abetter chance of staying cool like many of the houses in the world that are light grey 
28273	10	black the color black will keep the doghouses at ana average temperature of 53 deg c which i think this is a good mild temperature fora dog . the results also stated that the colors dark gray light gray and white would result ina 40 deg temperate which i believe would be too cold . i think it may get a bit hotter or colder temperature inside the doghouse because of the size difference ina jar but i still believe black would bethe best color to paint it .
28274	10	white less heat would go into the doghouse if they chose a white background
28275	10	light gray the light gray will affect the doghouse by c hanging the light gray color to possibly tow white
28276	10	white using white for the doghouse would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature . the black lid made the air temperature in the jar 53 deg c . the white lid made the air temperature in the jar 48 deg c . the white lid made the air temperature of the jar 5 deg c cooler than the black lid .
28277	10	white end
28278	10	dark gray dark gray might affect the doghouse because it will keep it warm in the winter and cool in the summer because it had an in between average temperature
28279	10	light gray light gray because it wouldnt absorb a lot of energy .
28280	10	black the color might affect the doghouse because it gets hotter .
28281	10	dark gray black might take the doghouse too hot because in the experiment black had an average temperature of 53 deg c . white would make the doghouse to cold because in the ex pi raiment the average temperature was 42 deg c . i chose dark gray because it wouldnt be to hot or to cold because it had an average temperature of 48 deg c .
28282	10	white i would choose white because white attracts the least amount of heat so the dog would stay nice and cool .
28283	10	light gray when its sunny outside and the dog is inside his or hers doghouse then they will get some nice heat because it is alight gray . if you used white then there wouldnt have been that much heat . and if it was dark gray or black then it would be too hot .
28284	10	black black would affect the doghouse by making it warmer so when its raining the dog can go inside the doghouse to get warmer because black absorbs more light and that can be heat . like in the experiment black averaged out to bethe warmest color and absorbed the most light .
28285	10	white the color white will not get as hot as the other colors because white as was shown in the table was the least hot
28286	10	white white would bethe best color for the dog house because white doesnt absorb as much heat as seen by the comparison of the average temperature so the inside of the doghouse wont be as hot
28287	10	black black would make the dog hose the hottest .
28288	10	dark gray if the doghouse was painted dark gray then the temperature inside the house would be warm . this is because it is a darker tone meaning it absorbs more heat . if brandi and jerry live ina cooler place this might help but it also works in warmer situations because then there is more heat to absorb versus the cooler place where there is less heat .
28289	10	white the white does not being in as much heat as the other colors .
28290	10	dark gray it will the doghouse not the hot and not that cold as well so pretty warm doghouse
28291	10	white the lightest color white will bethe least warm color in the doghouse . this is supported by the experiment data . white was the coldest temp 42 deg c while black was the hottest 53 deg c
28292	10	white how this color might effect the doghouse is that if doghouse is painted black it will heat up more because in brandi and jerry s experiment the black lid had a average of 53 deg c . the dark gray had an average of 48 deg c . white is the best because its average heat was 42 deg c .
28293	10	light gray i would choose light gray because its a happy medium . i will keep the doghouse cool while also keeping it warm . the average was 45 meaning the black might be to warm and the white might be to cool .
28294	10	black i chose the color black . this color can affect the doghouse by in the cold times being warm . but in the summer it will get hot most likely and that will force the dog out of his little doghouse to get some fresh air . in the experiment the temperature for the color black were 53 deg c on average and that is pretty high compared to the color whites temperature with it being 42 deg c average . and there is a big advantage if a black doghouse because when when you have a chilly weather you will have the black absorbing sunlight and any energy that is available comparing to white with absorbing barely anything .
28295	10	dark gray although dark gray can be really hot during the summer it wont be that hot during the winter . they need to balance it out . if they pick white it will be fine for the dog in the summer but the dog would freeze during the winter . if they pick black the dog would be sweating all the time in the summer but in the winter it wont be super freezing like when the white is painted during the winter .
28296	10	white it wont get as hot as the other colors . the white had the coldest average temperature at 42 .
28297	10	dark gray so in the summer its not to hotter but in the winter its not to cold . also the long will not have a heatstroke in the summer or freeze in the winter . also dark gray can hold in heat really good . so that why i thing they should use dark gray for the doghouse color .
28298	10	black if you paint it black it will keep the dog house warmer than if you had painted it white light gray or dark grey
28299	10	white brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse white so the dog doesnt get too hot when inside . they should do this so that when the sun shines down on the doghouse the inside temperature doesnt get too hot for the dog . the white lid only got to 42 deg c while the black got to 53 deg c and the dark gray got to 48 deg c and the light gray got to 45 deg c . if you dont want the dog to get too hot then they should paint the doghouse white . also because the white lid only heated up 18 deg c while the black heated up 29 deg c the dark gray 24 deg c and the light gray 21 deg c . they should paint the doghouse white so when the sun shines on the roof it doesnt get too hot inside for the dog .
28300	10	black from the results of the experiment black would be a good paint color for the doghouse because during the cold season but when there is some sun the dog would be kept the warmest . i know this because of the results of black is 53 deg c and dark gray was at 48 deg c . so the best color for the doghouse would be black .
28301	10	black the paint wont be ask thick as the others . since the black paint had the most average the black paint was finest which made it easier to paint and didnt smell as bad .
28302	10	black by black being the darkest color it will attract more heat for the doghouse . in every trial black was at least 4 degrees higher in temperature .
28303	10	dark gray during the day the doghouse would stay in the 40 s maybe 50 degrees so the dog wouldnt be too hot during the day and at night it would stay warm from all the heat the color caught during the day .
28304	10	white if it is really hot in the summertime then the dog could cool off in the doghouse because according to the experiment the color white absorbs less heat energy
28305	10	light gray i choose light gray because it gives the dog house an average temperature of 45 deg c not to hot not to cold
28306	10	light gray light gray would be a good color fora dog house because it lets a little heat in but not as much as dark grey and black k .
28307	10	black this color might affect the temperature of the doghouse because it will bethe warmest for the dog because the sun black color will soak up the warmth less of the sun and you want the dog to stay warm and not freeze to death .
28308	10	dark gray the dark grey would not make the doghouse very hot like the black paint which was at 53 deg average but it would not be as cool as the white paint which was at 42 deg average .
28309	10	white the inside of the doghouse will be cool rather than hot
28310	10	black the best paint color fora doghouse would be black . the data table shows that it increases air temperature the most so with a black doghouse the dog would always be warm when its inside of it .
28311	10	white i would suggest to color the doghouse white because white color doesnt absorb light it just reflects it and the dog would be more happy because the color is very cold looking because it doesnt absorb light . according to the data on the experiment the average of the white lid color is 42 deg the black color is 53 deg the dark gray color is 48 deg and the light gray color is 45 deg . so i prefer white color the most
28312	10	white the color white will affect the doghouse by cooling the inside down therefore making the house more comfortable for the dog . this is supported by the conclusion of their test because the test shows that the white lived cans average temperature was 42 deg c and the other results were 45 48 and 54 deg c showing that the white was cooler
28313	10	white using white paint for the doghouse would bethe coolest option for the paint . i think this because the white paint had the lowest temperature in the jar . on average the temperature inside the jar was only 42 deg c with the white paint . it was the lowest temperature out of the black 53 deg c dark grey 48 deg c and light grey 45 deg c . using the white paint would affect the doghouse by keeping it much cooler then the other colors . so the best option for the paint would be white .
28314	10	black the color might affect the inside of doghouse because the darker the color more light or heat energy attract . the inside of doghouse would be warmer than using a lighter color .
28315	10	black if you paint your doghouse black then it will bethe warmest . dark colors absorb energy way better than light colors do . in the data table it says that for the color black the jar temperature was 54 deg 52 deg 54 deg and the average was 53 deg . while the color white got 42 deg 43 deg 41 deg and their average temperature was 42 deg . therefore black would bethe best color to keep your dog warm .
28316	10	black i think that black might affect the doghouse because the numbers away higher than the other colors higher than there st of the numbers there all in the forties except for black i think all of them would work except for black because the numbers are higher than the other colors and i dont think that you would seethe color at night that is why i think that wouldnt work on the doghouse
28317	10	white this color would make the doghouse more cooler then another color because it is the lightest if you were to make the doghouse black it would be really hot because heat attract to black .
28318	10	white it might be to cold in the doghouse during the winter unlike if it was painted black then it would be warm but white doesnt attract as much heat so be good for summer .
28319	10	white white would bethe best paint color because it does not get as warm as the other colors . its average temperature after 10 minutes was 42 deg c unlike the other colors whose temperature after 10 minutes were black 53 deg c dark gray 48 deg c and light gray 45 deg c .
28320	10	dark gray cause it is a dark color but not to dark sot here will be air
28321	10	white the color white because in the experiment the whitecap got the lowest among of heat so the white will make it less hot for the dog .
28322	10	white the color white would be best for the dog house because it would keep it most cool . i know this because from the experiment the results from black were much warmer temperatures than the light colors like white . from the results in the table you can see that black was 1 degrees warmer than white . so in conclusion if you wanted to keep the dog house cool it would be best to use white .
28323	10	white it doesnt absorb heat like black and all the other dark colors . it would stay cooler in the doghouse .
28324	10	white white absorbed the least amount of energy in the data so if white were to bethe color of the doghouse the temperature inside would overall be lower than if the doghouse was painted a different color that would absorb more energy .
28325	10	light gray light gray is the best color to paint the doghouse because it wont attract much heat and it wont be cold so its perfect temperature fora dog a good temperature is usually at 45 deg c and the light gray has an average of 45 deg c so light gray will bethe beast
28326	10	black black absorbed more heat therefore that will keep the dog warm .
28327	10	black black would bethe best paint color because it would keep the inside of a doghouse warmer then the other colors . this is better because the dog would then be warmer at night then he would be with other colors . the data supports this . black got an average of 53 deg calcium which was 5 deg degrees warmer then the next warmest color dark gray .
28328	10	black the black paint will hold the heat in when it is cold outside
28329	10	black that color could keep the inside of the dog house more warm because the black sores the suns energy . i alsop picked black because the data of lids over the jars showed how black affected the temperature by making it warmer
28330	10	light gray they should make the doghouse light grey be sue it would keep it cool in the summer but warm in the winter
28331	10	light gray this color would be best because it would keep the dog cooled off in the summer but also keep it warmer in the winter if it was ever outside .
28332	10	black black will affect the doghouse by making it hotter because in the experiment the data show that the color black absorbed the most heat .
28333	10	white its gonna effect the temperature in the dog house 
28334	10	black the black color i chose will make the dog house warmer for the dig because black absorbs more energy than the other colors . black had an average of 53 deg c air temperature inside a glass jar while a white lid on a glass jar had only 42 deg c . thus making black the better choice because it will absorb more energy making the doghouse warmer for the dog .
28335	10	dark gray i think dark gray would be a good color because the starting temperature was 24 deg and its not to hot or to cold
28336	10	white white is the color to see at when you looking for the dog .
28337	10	white it would make the air inside the doghouse cooler making the dog want to be in it instead of outside .
28338	10	black the color black is a dark color which absorbs more energy . meaning that the air temperature would be quite warm and insulated . based on the table the average temperature inside a glass jar with a black lid was 53 deg c in 10 minutes . while a glass jar with a white lid had an average temperature of 42 deg c in 10 minutes both at a starting temperature of 24 deg c . so the darker the color of the lid on the glass earth higher the temperature inside it .
28339	10	dark gray it will keep the dog pretty warm but not too hot .
28340	10	black the darker the color the more energy is being absorbed . average temperature on the black was 53 deg c which was the highest and the average temperature for white 42 deg c was lowest
28341	10	white the white color as shown from the data has an average lower temperature than the other colors . as dogs naturally have fur and resent the heat much more than the cold it is more convenient for brandi and jerry assuming they do not have intentions of torturing the dog to paint the house white .
28342	10	black wont be to cold or to hot for the dog to be in 
28343	10	black black because if the sun is out then it will collect more energy then another color cause its darker
28344	10	light gray light gray because dark colors are shown to absorb more heat causing it to be hotter inside the doghouse and light colors dont absorb as much heat so making the doghouse roof light gray should make the doghouse heat wise better for the dog .
28345	10	light gray i chose light gray because you want your dog to be warm but not hot or cold . the doghouse will absorb energy but not a lot it is enough energy to keep your dog safe from being too hot and too cold .
28346	10	dark gray i chose black because the average data for black is 53 deg and i believe that temperature is enough to keep a dog warm but not extremely hot where the dog would want to stay outside of it
28347	10	black i chose black because black got hotter in ten minutes than all the other colors . also the color black absorbs more heat .
28348	10	light gray the inside of the doghouse wont be too cold or too hot . as the color is more dark the more hot it will be inside the doghouse . the average for the color black after 10 minutes was 53 deg c . the average for the color white after 10 minutes was 42 deg c .
28349	10	black black because instead of reflecting the us rays off the doghouse the us rays are absorbed .
28350	10	white white would be the best color for the doghouse because it stayed at a constant 42 deg when black stayed at a constant 53 deg
28351	10	white it would keep the house cooler then the other colors would
28352	10	white the color white will keep the doghouse cool for the dog . any of the darker colors would heat up the doghouse and the dog will be miserable .
28353	10	light gray i think they should paint the doghouse a light gray so that it can catch a little bit of heat but not to much so that the inside is extremely warm . i think if the choose the light gray the inside of the doghouse wont fall apart as fast as it would if they painted it a darker color such as black .
28354	10	light gray the best color to paint the doghouse is light gray . if the house is alight fray then the doghouse will stay at ana average of 45 degrees calcium therefore the doghouse wont be too warm or too cold .
28355	10	dark gray the doghouse might get to hot if you pant it black but it might get to cold if you pant it white . the average of black 53 and white 42 .
28356	10	light gray light gray would be a good choice because its not too cold and not too hot . it would make the inside of the doghouse perfect temperature . the average for dark gray is 48 deg c and light gray is 45 deg c . therefore light gray would be abetter color for the doghouse .
28357	10	dark gray i chose dark gray because the color affect the inside of the doghouse by the heat the dog wont be as hot or cold in the the house and he will have the right temperature because the temperature is 48 and the average is 48 .
28358	10	white the color white will be a really nice color because the average of the white lid was the lowest of all 4 colors .
28359	10	white i think they should use white because in winter they could bring the dog inside and plus dogs have fur to keep them warm . plus in the summer they cant shave off theyre fur all by themselves so having a white doghouse that absorbs less heat will keep the dog cooler .
28360	10	white white might affect the doghouse because it wont have that much energy or air for the dog to breath
28361	10	white if you were going to build a doghouse with a white roof then it would be much cooler then a doghouse with a darker c color roof . if you were going to build a white doghouse then you would need to live ina very hot area so the dog dose not freeze . the average them nature fora black roof was 53 deg c . the average temperature fora white doghouse is 42 deg c . there for there would be a 11 deg c temperature change between the two colors .
28362	10	light gray light gray is a good color for the doghouse because you dont want the doghouse be so dark ora nasty looking color .
28363	10	light gray in the summer months it wouldnt get to hot . in the winter months it would be enough to keep the dog warm .
28364	10	white white would bethe best color to do . i know this because dark colors or shades absorb heat so you dont want the dog to die from heat .
28365	10	dark gray i chose dark gray . it would be a good color because if its cold outside the dark gray would absorb more of the suns heat and energy than the light gray and white . if its was outside it would absorb less heat and energy from the sun than the black would .
28366	10	white if they choose this color then the inside of the doghouse will be kept cool based on their results .
28367	10	white white will make the inside cooler than if it was black because the darker the color the hotter it will be .
28368	10	light gray because the doghouse has hot air inside so i choose light gray .
28369	10	white the best color to paint the doghouse would be white because the white doghouse would absorb less light making the doghouse color so that the dog would not overheat .
28370	10	light gray the color will make the doghouse cooler than black or dark grey would but it would still be warmer than just plain white . in the diagram the difference in temperature is shown . with a black roof the doghouse would be 52 deg c . meanwhile the light grey roof would average at 45 deg c which is probably better for the dog .
28371	10	dark gray i think dark gray would bethe best color for the doghouse because the darker the color is the greater increase of the air temperature inside the doghouse . the doghouse needs to be warm and c oz for the dog . i didnt choose black because it would be to warm in the doghouse for him the dog already has fur to keep him warm si dark gray would probably bethe best for him .
28372	10	white a white doghouse would make the inside cooler . in the experiment a whitecap on ajar made a cooler jar inside than a black cap which made a warmer inside .
28373	10	light gray light gray might affect the inside of the dog house by making it warmer in cold weather but not to hot in warm weather . temperatures from the black lid and dark gray would be to hot at a average temperature of 53 deg for black and 48 for dark gray . and if the paint were white it could be to cold at a average temperature of 42 deg . light gray with a average of 45 deg would be 8 deg cooler than black 3 deg cooler than dark gray and 3 deg warmer than white .
28374	10	white the color white can effect the doghouse because in the summer the doghouse can give the dog shade to cool down and in the experiment it shows that white contains the least amount of heat . the color white only got up to 43 deg c while black got up to 54 deg c .
28375	10	white i choose white because its not a dark color and dark colors attract heat and bright color doesnt well at least i think so i hope im right
28376	10	light gray i said dark grey it will keep some heat in but will not be really hot
28377	10	white i would use the white paint for the doghouse because the lighter the color the cooler the temperature is . in the experiment the white lid on the jar had the lowest average temperature of 42 degrees while the black lid jar had an average of 52 degrees .
28378	10	black it would make the doghouse hotter inside because its highest in the experiment was 54 and every other color was 48 to bethe closest .
28379	10	dark gray dude
28380	10	white the color white will affect the temperature in the doghouse because white absorbs least energy because it is a brighter color . for example in the experiment the white color had the least average air temperature . the average temperature was 42 degree calcium . the average temperature for the darker colors was greater . for example the color black had an average air temperature of 53 degree celsius .
28381	10	dark gray dark gray is the more suitable color because inside the doghouse it would be a constant temperature of 48 deg c and more comfortable for the dog .
28382	10	white i chose the color white because it will make the doghouse less hot because the color white doesnt absorb as much heat as the other three colors . in the other experiment the first trial black was 54 deg c dark gray was 48 deg c light gray was 44 deg c and finally white was 42 deg c
28383	10	black the black color will absorb most of the heat
28384	10	white it will keep it cooler because light colors dont absorb as much energy as dark colors
28385	10	white the color white could effect the doghouse because on a hot day it could get too hot for their dog and could get exhausted and this way it wont get too hot and maybe increase the chances oft he dog to have more energy .
28386	10	white i think white is the best answer to this question . because darker colors absorb heat as much heat as possible but white doesnt absorbed as much heat because it isnt as dark as black dark grey and light grey . this color will keep it cap ina doghouse .
28387	10	black darker colors absorb more light . if they use black then in winter it will be a little warmer .
28388	10	dark gray the dark gray color would bethe best because the doghouse would have to be cool and warm enough fort he dog to be in it . the dark gray color absorbs the right amount of light energy and keeps it balanced .
28389	10	white it will make so then it is not as hot in the doghouse because in the experiment the whites temperature was the lowest out of them all .
28390	10	white in the summer you would want to paint your doghouse white so it doesnt get so hot in there . the color white is ana average 5 deg cooler than the color black .
28391	10	light gray i think they should use alight gray paint because the inside of the doghouse would become a alright temperature for the dog and it is better than black or dark grey because those colors would make the inside of the doghouse to hot fora dog . seeing how the results were the light grey would be around 45 deg c and any below or above that would have a air temperature that too hot or cold . if it was summer the energy from the sun heat in the doghouse would be cooler because the color was lighter .
28392	10	black the color black might affect the doghouse because it was proven that the color black increases the temperature . so if you choose the color black it will affect the doghouse by increases the temperature to keep the dog warm .
28393	10	light gray this might affect the doghouse by keeping the dog warm in the winter but not really cold . since they have fur the dog house doesnt need to be warm on the motherland in the peak of summer the dog would need a chilled pace to get out of the sun . so the light grey would keep the dog warm in winter and cold in the summer .
28394	10	black it affect the doghouse because the darker the color the more increase in air temperature .
28395	10	black black would bethe best color because according g to the graph the darker the color black was 53 c the hotter the surface and the lighter the color white was 42 c the cooler the temperature .
28396	10	white the white color is not the hottest one but when it is a hot day you want the doghouse to be cool as possible . if you wanted to get warm you go outside . because the change between the starting temperature is less this may mean that the doghouse absorbs less of the heat . if it is a cold day i think that the white doghouse will stay a more ideal temperature all day than a darker colored doghouse .
28397	10	dark gray dark gray would give an average temperature of 48 deg c . this temperature would not be to hot for the dog nor would it be to cold .
28398	10	white the color of the doghouse should be white because it doesnt absorb as much heat as a black doghouse . in the experiment the average temperature of the glass with a black lid was 53 deg c after ten minutes with a lamp over it . the average temperature of the glass with a white lid was 42 deg c after ten minutes with a lamp over it . since 53 deg c is greater then 42 deg c the white lid takes in less heat .
28399	10	black it will keep the dog warm while its outside
28400	10	white this color would affect the doghouse by it being colder in the doghouse then the other colors would make it because from the experiment it said that white was a 42 deg c .
28401	10	white painting a doghouse white would keep a dog cool whereas painting the house black would increase the air temperature and cause the dog to be hot because darker colors absorb more energy . after 10 minutes under the lamp the white lids average temperature was 42 deg c . in comparison the black lids average temperature in 10 minutes was 53 deg c . therefore painting a doghouse white or any light color for that matter winds down to a happy owner and a happy dog according to the results from the experiment .
28402	10	white i would chose white because white wont attract that much heat and it will keep the inside cooler . but if it were black than it would make it all hot .
28403	10	black the results of the experiment showed that black was able to absorb the most heat seeing that its average was 53 degrees . while white got an average of 42 degrees . this means that there will be plenty more heat inside the doghouse than with any other color on any c old day .
28404	10	light gray i think they should have the doghouse painted light gray because in the experiment the air inside at average was 45 deg c and white was a little to cold 42 deg c and black would make it to hot 53 deg c . light gray would bethe safest fora dog so it doesnt get to hot nor cold .
28405	10	light gray light gray may effect the dog house ina good way because it daylight it will be bright then at night it will be dark enough instead of bright white .
28406	10	dark gray the dark grey wouldnt be hot like an average of 53 deg it would be somewhere in the middle like 48 deg .
28407	10	white it would make it cooler indirect sunlight
28408	10	black black because the darker the doghouse the greater the increase in air temperature inside the doghouse 
28409	10	white white because light colors dont get as much energy from the sun as the dark colors do . and looking back at there experiment the white paint had the less energy the results where 42 deg 43 deg 41 deg and lastly was 42 deg .
28410	10	black it will make the inside of the doghouse hotter by the color black because the sun is attracted by the color
28411	10	white this color might affect the doghouse because since it has the lowest average of temperature it would be good for your dog so it does not get to hot in the doghouse . the temperature of the white lid jar is 42 deg c for the light gray it is 45 deg c for the dark gray it is 48 deg c and for the black it is 53 deg c . that shows that the white lid jar has the lowest temp and is the best choice for the doghouse .
28412	10	black pens due es
28413	10	white brandi and jerry should use white paint color because in the experiment it showed that a dark color like black absorbs lots of heat from the sun . if you use a dark color it gets to much heat from the sun and then inside the doghouse it would be hot . the dog already has its fur to keep it warm so i dont think the dog would like it to be any hotter .
28414	10	white the white will reflect sunlight leaving the inside of the doghouse cooler . i know this because when a white lid was used in the experiment the jar was 42 deg c . light gray was 45 deg c on average dark gray was 48 deg c and black was 53 deg c .
28415	10	dark gray dark gray would make the doghouse warmer but not as hot as black . since the air in the jar with the black lid was warmest at aug . of 53 deg c and dark gray was next warmest at a aug . of 48 deg c its would keep the doghouse ina in between temp nature . not to hot not to cold .
28416	10	black blackwell affect the doghouse by keeping it warm . darker colors absorb more energy .
28417	10	white white would bethe best color fora doghouse because dogs can easily overheat especially in summer so the lower you can possibly keep the temperature the better .
28418	10	dark gray if you put dark colors .
28419	10	white it would shine and the dog would see its house but it can get muddy early an fast .
28420	10	dark gray dark grey would bethe best because the temp was the second highest so when its cold outside the doghouse will still get some heat but when its hot out the dog wont die of heatstroke .
28421	10	white painting the doghouse white would affect the temperature inside the doghouse because white retells light while black absorbs light . the white lid cover was 11 degrees cooler than the black . unless they want their dog to die of overheating they should paint the house white .
28422	10	light gray i chose this color because it took on less heat than any other lid except for the white lid . it also was warm enough in ten minuets of time that it would be about 70 deg c during midday . the temperature would keep the dog warm in the winter and cool in the summer .
28423	10	light gray i chose light gray so that the doghouse wont be to hot from the black or the dark gray . i didnt pick the white so that the doghouse wont be to cold for the dog .
28424	10	light gray this color might affect the doghouse by the temperature . light grey is best choice for the doghouse because you dont want the dog to be too hot or too cold in the doghouse . darker colors absorb heat better based on the experiment because the darkest color had the hottest jar which its temperature was 53 deg c and the lightest color had the coldest jar which was 42 deg c so i chose the color that is right in between the other darker and lighter colors .
28425	10	dark gray if they give the dog a dark grey doghouse the dog wont die of heat in the summer if you give it a water bowl and in the winter he will beat a comfy heat
28426	10	dark gray i chose the color dark grey because st of all this color was on the upper side of the data meaning it absorbed more energy leaving the space with a higher air temperature . it absorbs energy like black but it doesnt absorb as much . it makes it warm enough forth e winter and cool enough for the summer . the data states the average air temperature for the jar with a dark grey lid was 48 deg c which would be fine for an animal considering they have fur .
28427	10	dark gray dark gray will keep the dog warm in the winter and cool in the summer because it doesnt attract too much heat but just enough to stay warm .
28428	10	black the dark colors absorb more energy .
28429	10	light gray so the doghouses wont be to bright or too dark .
28430	10	brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse white if they want the doghouse to stay cool because the white lid had the lowest temperatures with an average of 42 deg c . if brandi and jerry want the doghouse to stay warm they should paint it black because the black lid had the warmest temperatures with an average of 53 deg c . if they want the doghouse to be warm and cool they should desire weather they want it to be slightly warmer or slight cooler . if they want it to be slightly warmer they should paint the doghouse dark gray the yard gray lid it had the second warmest temperatures with an average of 48 deg c . if brandi and jerry would like the doghouse slightly cooler they should paint it light gray the light gray lid had the second coolest temperatures with an average of 45 deg c . it all depends on how warm or cool they want the dog house to be .
28431	10	light gray the color light gray is the best color for the doghouse because black is to warm average temp . 53 deg c dark gray is warm too average temp . 48 deg c white is to cold average temp . 48 deg c and light gray is not to cold average temp . 45 deg c and is not to hot for the dog .
28432	10	white i think white is the best color because in the dada it say that the temperature of the jar was 41 43 deg c therefore it wont be so hot inside the doghouse 
28433	10	black the best color would be black because since the darker colors absorbed more heat then it will keep the inside warm for the dog
28434	10	white it doesnt absorb as much heat . the average te murat for the white was 42 deg c
28435	10	white the color white would make the doghouse cooler less hot inside than the others colors . that statement is supported by their experiment in the following way . the average temperature for all the colors was black 53 deg dark gray 48 deg light gray 45 deg and white 42 deg . that shows that the average temp future for white is lower than any of those other colors
28436	10	dark gray for dark gray to be in the glass jar for 10 minutes i picked that color because its the same trial over and over again but also because of the average .
28437	10	dark gray dark gray would affect the doghouse by making it warm but not to hot inside . i know this because the average temp . after 10 min . was 48 deg c . unlike the black whom was at 53 deg c with the highest temp . and white at 42 deg c with the lowest temp .
28438	10	white this color would keep the doghouse cooler for the dog .
28439	10	light gray brandi and jerry should use the light gray paint for the doghouse because in the experiment with the light grays tempi true was in the middle it wasnt to hot and it wasnt to cold it was only between 44 deg f and 46 deg f so it will bethe perfect tempi true inside the doghouse in the summer and in the winter .
28440	10	white the doghouse will be cooler for the dog in the summer when the dog is spending time outside .
28441	10	black depending on the area that you live in i think that black would bethe best color for the doghouse . the reason i say this is because that the color black during the experiment absorbed the most heat with an average of 53 deg f over the dark greys average of 48 deg flight greys 45 deg f and also the whites average of 42 deg f . the highest average temperature of the black paint would allow the dog to keep warmer during the cooler seasons of the year such as winter fall and even spring in some areas .
28442	10	white the color white might affect the doghouse because darker colors trap light so a lighter color will keep the doghouse cooler than if it was a darker color .
28443	10	light gray this color will keep the doghouse warm inside but not to hot .
28444	10	light gray it will repel most heat as to keep the doghouse cool in the summer but it has a small amount of heat attraction so that if the dog is outside in the winter he can get a little heat .
28445	10	white it will stop heat concentration on the dog house and cool the doghouse .
28446	10	dark gray the lighter the color the less energy it absorbs . dark gray will be warm in the cold but cold in the heat .
28447	10	black for the doghouse i would use black . i would chose this color because the color would absorb more heat and warm the doghouse more . in this experiment black had an average temperature of 53 deg while white had an average temp of 42 deg
28448	10	dark gray dark gray is a good color because its effect towards the heat will keep it a good temperature . it isnt as hot as black which averages out to 53 deg c and it wont be as cold as the white which averaged out to 42 deg c .
28449	10	dark gray the color will affect the doghouse by getting warm
28450	10	black when it is cold and the dog has to sleep outside black attract the sun more and the dog will be warmer
28451	10	white the best paint for the doghouse would be white because it will keep the house at a nice temperature because if the house temperature would be black then we could predict that the temperature inside the house would be about 53 deg c so if the color was white then we could predict based on the experiment that the temperature would be about 42 deg c .
28452	10	black if they painted the doghouse black it would make the doghouse warmer then the other colors because in the experiment black was the hottest average point .
28453	10	white it affects the doghouse because then the dog use wont absorbed any non needed temperature in the summertime .
28454	10	white i would choose a white color because it doesnt absorb much heat from the sun . black absorbs more heat because in the table it shows that the water in the black lid had a greater amount thant he other colors there were . so white would bethe better choice . the doghouse would have cooler air .
28455	10	black the darker color will absorbed more energy so there will be more heat
28456	10	white in the experiment the black and darker color lids were the ones with the hottest temperature so white is the best
28457	10	black dark gray
28458	10	white i chose white because the darker the color the hotter the air temperature is . white is the lightest color and would therefore reflect the light instead of absorbing it .
28459	10	white using white for the color of the doghouse would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler because in the experiment the white lid color stayed coolest under the lamp .
28460	10	black the darker the color the more light the dog house will get .
28461	10	white i think they should pan the dog house white because in the experiment the jar with the white lid had the coolest air temperature so if you painted the doghouse white it would stay cooler in the day so the dog wouldnt overheat 
28462	10	white this color will make the doghouse be colder than all of the other colors the temperature for it was 42 deg and the others were higher than that
28463	10	light gray it would not get hot enough in the summer to overheat and kill the dog but it is unlikely in the winter it will die from the cold .
28464	10	white the doghouse will stay cooler in the summer time when it is hot .
28465	10	white out of all the colors that were used in this experiment white had the lowest deg c . the jar with the black lid had 53 deg c but the dark gray only had 48 deg c as for the light gray that had 45 deg c and finally white had only 42 deg c . this data shows that the white doghouse would bethe best choice since dogs have fur to keep them warm but in the summer it would be hot they would need a house that could keep them cool but if the person wanted a house for the dog that would keep the dog warm but not to hot and cool but not to cool they would need to pick between the dark gray and the light gray colors since those colors keep around the same temperature .
28466	10	black it might make it hot in the dog have
28467	10	black the best color so keep your dog warm and not cold is black it contains more heat and it sores a lot of the heat out side of it
28468	10	black black will affect the doghouse because it absorbs more light and an the heat of the doghouse will increase because the black jars average temperature was 53 deg c and the coolest jar white jar had an average of 42 deg c . the black jar was 11 . 25 deg c hotter then the white .
28469	10	light gray i think they should use light gray paint . the light gray paint would help keep in some other heat but not all of it . in the experiment the darkest colored lid black kept a temperature of 5 3 deg c on average . the lightest color white kept an average temperature of 42 deg c . this shows the darker the color the higher the temperatures . the lighter the color the lower the temperatures .
28470	10	white i think the best color fora doghouse would be white as it keeps the dog house at a pleasantly cool temperature protecting the dog from excessive heat . the evidence to backup this assumption is shown in the data table as the white being the color that kept the doghouse the coolest .
28471	10	white the inside of the doghouse will be cooler because the heat is going to reflect off the sun . with white the air temp was only 42 deg but with black the air temp was 54 deg
28472	10	dark gray this color may affect the doghouse because it is said that black attracts heat and white reflects heat if the doghouse is dark gray then it might take in heat during the summer while the dog is outplaying and then keep the dog warm at night while sleeping but it could also retract some heat so it wont make the dog too hot because its not all the way black .
28473	10	light gray if they painted the doghouse light gray it wouldnt be too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter .
28474	10	light gray the doghouse will stay cool but not to cold and not to hot .
28475	10	black the color black would affect the doghouse because the darker colors will bring more heat to the doghouse so the dog house will be warmer .
28476	10	white white might effect the doghouse because . . it will get dirty easier inside and out
28477	10	white this color is bright and reflects the suns rays . it had an average of 42 deg c while black had 53 deg c as an average . this makes the inside of the doghouse cooler .
28478	10	black the color black will affect the doghouse because the darker the color the more warmer it will be on the inside according to the experiment that brandi and jerry did unlike white the color white would make it more cool
28479	10	white the best color to paint the doghouse would be white because the white wouldn t make the inside of the doghouse ash o . in trial one of the black lid the temperature of the inside of the jar was 54 deg c . in the first trial of the white lid the temperature of the inside of the jar was 42 deg c .
28480	10	white it would probably make it cooler inside the dog house when the sun reflects on it . . . if it were darker it would attract more heated energy and make the doghouse warmer inside . so i would paint it white because it would attract heat but no in the inside .
28481	10	dark gray well since dark colors attract more heat the dog would be warm in his or her doggie house . if i would of chosen black the dog might be to hot and not really want to come inside it .
28482	10	black if brandi and jerry paint the doghouse black then the inside of the doghouse would be warmer because after 10 minutes under the lamp the average temperature for the black lid was 53 deg c when the other colors were in the 40 s range .
28483	10	black how black might effect the doghouse is it would stay warm inside because any dark colors the sun is attracted to it .
28484	10	light gray well would choose light gray because it would keep the dog warm if it was cold out . and if it was was hot out the dog would not get to cold and not to hot .
28485	10	white how this color will affect the inside of the doghouse will be by keeping it cool because in the hypothesis its aid that darker the color greater increase in the air temperature .
28486	10	black i chose black for the doghouse because that way the dog will stay warm . i say this because in the experiment the average for the black lid was at 53 deg which was the greatest temperature out of the 4 colors .
28487	10	black if they painted the doghouse black then the doghouse would be warmer inside because in the experiment black was the color that absorbed the most heat because the temperature in the jar was the warmest .
28488	10	dark gray war gray would bethe best because its right in the middle it would be warm in colder whether and cool in hotter whether making the dog as comfy as possible . hot cool . cold warm
28489	10	white if the doghouse was painted white the air temperature inside the doghouse would be a lot cooler than if it were painted a darker color . in the experiment the average temperature for the jar with the white lid was 42 deg . for the light gray it was 45 deg for the dark gray it was 48 deg and for the black it was 53 deg . the jar with the white lid had the lowest average temperature .
28490	10	white this color would make the doghouse the least hot out of the other colors
28491	10	black black absorbed the most heat
28492	10	black they should paint it black because the jar with the black lid had the highest air temperature . so if the doghouse is black then the air temperature inside the doghouse will be fairly warm . so in the winter the dog will still be warm because the dark color attracts heat .
28493	10	black black will affect the inside because it will make it dark inside of it . if it was white it wouldnt be s dark . if it was dark grey it would be dark but not as dark and if it was light grey it would be lighter then the black and dark grey .
28494	10	white white because it does not heat up as much . but if they lived ina cold region then they might want to paint it black because it warms the air temp around it . but they would probably let the dog stay in she for the winter so white would be good . also if its now brandy and jerry wouldnt be able to seethe doghouse because it is white . also white becomes less clean overtime there for they should pick a color that suit there region not if it is warmer or colder . because those thing can be controlled unlike snow patterns and rain and mud .
28495	10	light gray i picked light gray because its a color that would absorb heat and also reflect it . i think this because the temperature s stayed above 43 deg c and but also stayed below 48 deg c
28496	10	white the color will affect the dog house by being cooled down for the dog togo when its sunny
28497	10	dark gray dark gray is the best color for the doghouse because the temperature isnt too high its 48 deg for each trial . and the other colors temperature go up and down for each trial .
28498	10	white if you painted the doghouse white the tempt are in the doghouse would be less because darker colors attract more heat . having white painting would be better for the dog because he will be c color in his doghouse but if the doghouse was a darker color such as black or dark grey the dog would be a lot warmer . the data shows that the average deg c for black paint was 53 deg and the average deg c fort he white paint was 42 deg . the white house was sunni finally cooler with a difference between the two temperatures of 11 deg c which would make the doghouse a lot better for the dog .
28499	10	dark gray i think they should use dark gray because the dog needs warmth and the dark gray provides 48 deg which is pretty warm fora dog
28500	10	dark gray i think that the dark gray is the best choice because it stays at a constant degrees of 84 degrees . the whole time and that good because the dog will always beat the same temperature . and i dont like the house to be different temperatures so i think that the dog wont either .
28501	10	light gray that color light gray will not absorb too much heat from the sun keeping the doghouse cooler . but it also absorbs minimal heat since it isnt pure white .
28502	10	white white will absorb the least amount of heat . it will be nice and cool inside the doghouse . on average white got the smallest amount of heat inside the jar at 42 deg c .
28503	10	white it will keep the house cool .
28504	10	white it will make it cooler because its a lighter color .
28505	10	white it will make it less hot for the dog since white attracts less heat .
28506	10	black if the doghouse is painted black it will be warmer for the dog because it collects the light . it will be about 10 deg warmer for the dog then using the white paint . in trial 1 the doghouse was 12 deg warmer then the white doghouse and 10 deg warmer then the light gray doghouse . in the dark gray doghouse it was 48 deg which was 6 deg cooler then the black doghouse .
28507	10	white white would be best cause in the summer white wont get the inside of the doghouse to be too hot for the dog but black will make the doghouse extremely hot
28508	10	white their going to want to use white because its hows that the whites average was 42 compared to black the darkest colors average was 53 .
28509	10	light gray light gray wont allow the dog to overheat while in it but it also wont allow the dog to get too cold . this is because the gray part of light gray sores sun while the white part deflects it .
28510	10	light gray it will make it so the doghouse doesnt get on hot or to cold .
28511	10	black the best color for the doghouse is black cob se black got the best average
28512	10	white white will keep the light out of the dog house and it is alight color . it will not get the doghouse to hot . the white will absorbed less heat from the sun . black was in the 50 deg dark grey was in the high 40 deg light grey was in the mid 40 deg and whit was in the low 40 deg which makes it the coolest color to paint ado g house .
28513	10	dark gray i chose dark gray because the darker the color the more heat it holds . if you paint the doghouse black it could hold to much heat in the summer and if you paint it white it wont have enough heat in the winter .
28514	10	white if you use white then the doghouse will be cooler because the average heat was the lowest with 42 deg
28515	10	light gray i think light gray because so that way the dog inside wont be so hot and it will always be warm inside for the dog the dog wont ever be to hot or to cold .
28516	10	white white will allow the doghouse to be cooler than a black one because it reflects light . light includes sunlight as welland black absorbs light more so white would work . in the experiment the black lid caused thea ir temperature to rise to an average of 53 deg c . the white lid however caused the air temperature to rise to an average of 42 deg c .
28517	10	light gray the color will affect it because in the winter it will be warm enough for the dog so it wont get sick and it will be cool enough in the summer for the dog in the doghouse .
28518	10	white white will effect the doghouse by not making it hot for the dog because you dont want your dog to be hot at night . and i say this because in the scenario it says that darker colors attract more energy and the graph shows that white is less hot than black
28519	10	black a black lid will make the inside of the doghouse warmer then any of the other lids . it will be warmer because the darker the color the warmer the object will get . i know this because i averaged out the trials and the averages were white 42 light gray 45 dark gray 48 black 53 therefore the black lid was the darkest color and it was the warmest and the white was the lightest color and it was the coolest .
28520	10	black the temperature will affect the doghouse .
28521	10	light gray i believe that they should paint the doghouse right gray so that while the doghouse stays cool it may also be semi warm seeing how darker colors soak up more energy from the sun . in the experiment the black lid was the hottest and the white the coldest . due to these results it is best togo with a more in between colors so that the temperature may even out .
28522	10	white if they painted the doghouse white it would cause the lowest internal temperature of the doghouse . on average the jar with the white lid reached 42 deg c after 10 minutes while the jar with the black lid reached on average 53 deg c after 10 minutes . that is a difference of 11 degrees therefore white would bethe best choice .
28523	10	black black might effect the doghouse ina way where the temperature might be warmer since in the experiment the black color had an average of 53 deg and white had an average of 42 deg . so if you paint the doghouse black it will be warmer .
28524	10	black black will make the doghouse have the most heat inside to keep the dog warm during cold days . when a black lid was placed over a glass jar it averaged the highest air temperature with 53 deg c . dark gray averaged 48 deg c light gray averaged 45 deg c and white averaged 42 deg c . black has the most heat to keep dogs warm during cold days .
28525	10	white i would say the white house because the white house is much cooler than the other colors because it isnt to cold or to hot its the the right temperature .
28526	10	dark gray dark grey would be best for the doghouse because you wouldnt want your dog to be to hot or too cold at night and dark gray keeps the right temperature . because its average temperature is 48 deg c
28527	10	black the color will effect the heat inside the doghouse . black will make it warmer and white will make it cooler . the darker the doghouse the hotter it will be . if you want a hot doghouse black is the best if you want a cool doghouse white would be abetter color choice .
28528	10	dark gray when it is too hot the dog can go in the lighter colored doghouse to have a little cooler temperature . when it is cold he can go inside to warm up if there is sun .
28529	10	white because white is the lightest color it willa absorb the least amount of energy so the air temperature will be the coolest . for example the average temp . for the darkest color black was 53 deg while the average for the lightest color white 42 deg . in conclusion in order to have the coolest doghouse they need to paint it white .
28530	10	black because at night the dog wouldnt be able to see it because it would be dark out .
28531	10	dark gray its dark gray because the darker the lid is the grater it increases in air temperature in the doghouse darker color absorbs more energy .
28532	10	black because black has the most air temp . then any other colors
28533	10	white white would affect the doghouse because white reflects all colors so it would colder in the doghouse making it more comfortable for the dog .
28534	10	light gray the light gray paint would keep the doghouse at a just right temperature . the black and dark gray paint would be do hot their average temperature in the jar being 53 deg c and 48 deg c . the white paint would make the doghouse to cold its average temperature in the jar being 42 deg c . so the light gray would make the doghouse the perfect temperature for the dog its temperature being a nice 45 deg c .
28535	10	dark gray the color dark gray would bethe best because it effects the doghouse by attracting heat to the doghouse . how i know this is the temperature for the glass jar with the dark gray lid were 48 48 48 and 48 making the doghouse about the same temperature .
28536	10	light gray i think light grey . just because its easily in the middle of the temperatures . not too hot and also not too cold .
28537	10	white white doesnt attract heat like the color black does
28538	10	black if brandi amp jerry live ina very cold place a black doghouse would be a good home for the dog . according to their experiment the darker colors absorbed more heat than the lighter colors . the black lid made the air in the jar have an average temperature more than 11 deg c warmer than the white lid . if they live ina very warm area they should paint it white to keep the dog cool .
28539	10	white it will affect the doghouse because the darker the color the hotter it gets so the lighter the cooler the less hot it is that is why white is the best color for the doghouse .
28540	10	white if the doghouse is painted white then incas e it ever gets really hot outside their dog wont get too hot while hes inside it .
28541	10	white i chose white because in the graph it says the average is and the others are 53 48 45 so white is the coolest color .
28542	10	black black because it is the warmest c deg color so in the winter your dog will not freeze to death because its warmer then white dark grey and light grey .
28543	10	white the color white would effect the doghouse by making it cooler inside cause in the data it showed that the color white had the lowest temperature out of the other 3 colors
28544	10	black black because the sun is attracted to darker colors to make them light
28545	10	white i would paint it white because it wouldnt be to hot or cold for the dog it would be just right
28546	10	black white is the best color for the doghouse because it would keep the doghouse the coldest . the average temperature for the white jar was 42 deg c the light gray jar average temperature was 45 deg c the dark gray jar average was 48 deg c and the black jar average was 53 deg c . even though all of the jars temperatures increased the white jar stayed the coolest .
28547	10	white wouldnt be as hot for the dog compared to any darker colors i know this from the experiment they did
28548	10	black it might affect it by cause its black and maybe that dog and the family dont really want black for thereof house that s maybe why that they just dont like or dislike that color
28549	10	white you would want to use white because in the experiment a white lid kept the inside of the jar the coolest which means it would bethe best fora doghouse that way the dog wouldnt get to hot .
28550	10	white the doghouse might get warm inside on a hot sunny day
28551	10	black if they were to choose black for there dog house color it will attract more sunlight compared to the other colors shown in there data table . this might affect the comfort zone of the dog especially in the summer because the sun will be more attracted to the color black making it to warm in the doghouse .
28552	10	white this color will not absorb much heat during the summer so the dog wont get as thirsty .
28553	10	dark gray dark gray would bethe best color for the roof of a doghouse because it will keep the doghouse cool in the hotter months and warm in the colder months . the temperature never really changed with that color so it will probably bethe best for the dog considering it has its fur coat too .
28554	10	light gray the light gray color i chose will not make the house too hot but it will stay warm during the summer and the winter . i know this because on the experiment the jar was only about 45 deg c . which will be perfect for the dog .
28555	10	white if the paint color is white then it will keep the doghouse cooler because from the results of the experiment it states that white has the coolest temperature with 42 deg c
28556	10	white the white color would effect the doghouse by not attracting that much of light . i say this because in the experiment the white had less heat attracting to the jar the highest it when was about 43 deg c
28557	10	light gray brandi and jerry should use light gray because the average temperature was 45 degrees celsius . a dog has a lot of fur so the temperature shouldnt bee too warm but also not too cold .
28558	10	white with white paint as opposed to gray of black there will be less heat in the inside of the doghouse . it will be colder . as brandi and jerry saw in the experiment the jar with white paint was on average 11 degrees colder than the jar with a black lid . light gray was three degrees warmer and dark grey was six degrees warmer . so it is logical to conclude that a white roofed doghouse is the best option especially if they plan to put the doghouse ina place that it will get hot . if the doghouse is somewhere very cold however such as siberia . then it would be more beneficial to have adar her roof .
28559	10	white usually you will not want the dog to attract heat in the summer so it would be white and in the winter you might want it to be black so it does attract heat
28560	10	black you might get abetter color because the average of black was 53 deg
28561	10	white the color might affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler when the sun it shining on it . this will keep the dogs more c comfortable .
28562	10	dark gray the temp . wouldnt be too high or too low . during the summer the dog would stay a good temp . i think for me because for dark gray the aug . temp . is 48 deg . it all depends on how hot your dog likes to be how warm the usual are what time of year aug tamp . at the location for the doghouse . how often will the dog be in the doghouse . what times of day will the dog be in the doghouse and whats the aug . temp natures for the doghouse location .
28563	10	white it will make the doghouse cooler in the summer . the darker the color the more the doghouse will absorb heat therefore white would bethe best color .
28564	10	light gray light gray would affect the inside of the doghouse by not allowing it to get to hot for the dog and it offers a nice place for the dog to cool down if it is hot outside . black and dark gray would be to hot i think and white would be to cold for comfort .
28565	10	white might keep it cooler
28566	10	light gray it will affect the doghouse by when it is hot out it will stay cooler than a black doghouse because it attracts less heat energy but if it is colder it will help attract enough heat to be warmer than a white doghouse like in the experiment compared to a high temperature of 54 deg calcium from black light greys was a 46 deg high . so would be much cooler in hot weather .
28567	10	black if they paint it black then the doghouse would become warmer inside because darker colors attract sunlight .
28568	10	white so the inside stays cool since white it absorb less energy .
28569	10	black black is the best color for the doghouse because it absorbs more energy from the light . the average temperature inside a black doghouse would be 53 degrees calcium so the dog would be warm outdoors .
28570	10	white it would keep the inside of the doghouse colder than the darker colored ones .
28571	10	black black paint would make the temperature inside the doghouse warmer . in the experiment the black lid trial average temperature was 53 deg c the highest of all the other average temperatures . compared to the other lids the black paint produced 5 deg c 8 deg c and 11 deg c more . thus the inside of the doghouse would be warmest if painted black .
28572	10	light gray i chose the light grey color because it wont be to hot or to cold inside the doghouse .
28573	10	dark gray if its to hot outside its cool inside the doghouse . if its cold outside its not so cold inside .
28574	10	white the doghouse would be cooler inside so the dog will want togo in it on a hot day
28575	10	light gray i would choose the light gray because in brandi and jerry s experiment they figured out that darker lids do absorb more heat than lighter lids . so i would not want to have the doghouse to be to hot black lid or to cold white lid . so i just thought that the good amount of hot and cold was light gray .
28576	10	black i think that they should use black because if it gets dirty then you wont beagle to tell .
28577	10	light gray i like football . i like ponies . i like chocolate . i like race cars . i dont like your stupid test
28578	10	white the white pant reflexes the light not ex sobs it like black . the white pant will keep the dog cool in the doghouse when it is warm outside . but the only problem is it would get cold during the winter when there is little sun .
28579	10	white a white doghouse will make the doghouse not as worm as black . our high data was 53 deg chin the lid color was black our low data was 42 deg c white the lid color was white the difference was 11 deg c .
28580	10	white if there is white paint on the doghouse then it wont get as hot as if they painted it black . the lighter the paint then the cooler inside it will be for the dog .
28581	10	dark gray dark gray can keep the doghouse warm in the winter and cool during the summer .
28582	10	dark gray this color dark gray might affect the dog house by making it warmer for the animal inside . i chose dark gray instead of white or black because if the doghouse was white or light gray the inside temperature would be colder than if it was black . at the same time however the inside temperature might become too hot for the animal inside causing it to become uncomfortable . as the data from the experiment shows the average for the black colored lid was 53 deg c while thea average temperature for the white colored lid was 42 deg c . this shows that darker colors heat up more quickly when exposed to light energy than lighter colors . i chose the color dark gray because that way when the temperature outside is colder the doghouse will obtain more heat from the sunlight that its exposed to . in turn the doghouse might act as an insulator . in the summer however it will not become as hot inside the doghouse as it would if it was black . this way by choosing a color that is neither extremely dark or extremely light this doghouse will have a reason for each season .
28583	10	white because the different color lid did change the temp of the inside of the container i would put a white roof on the doghouse 
28584	10	light gray i think the color light gray would be good to paint the doghouse . i think this because i know that dogs need a cooler temperature to be comfortable and it cant be too hot inside . it cannot be too cold either though . from the experiment the black lid was clearly the one that made the jar hottest and white made it less hot . you want something in between so i chose light gray to be on the safe side .
28585	10	white white is the lightest color because it is light the temperature in the doghouse will decrease but if you choose ad parker color like black . the color will absorb the heat and increase the temperature .
28586	10	black if the doghouse was black it would absorb more heat in the winter and keep the heat locked in .
28587	10	white white would work for inside because you can c control texture in inside the doghouse 
28588	10	white if you wanted to keep the doghouse cool you would want the roof to be white because white is the color that doesnt t hold in heat compared to black . the black inside the glass was about 53 deg c . the dark gray was about 48 deg c . the light gray was still 45 deg c but the white was much cooler with about 42 deg c . the best choice would bethe coolest temperature which would be white .
28589	10	light gray the temperature inside the house wouldnt be so hot because the color would be light gray which has the second lowest temperature average out of the four . it went up 20 22 deg c from its starting temperature while dark gray and black had higher temperature increase . white had the lowest which would be too cold . the dog has fur so it should be able to be warm enough but also cant get too hot so light gray would bethe best .
28590	10	white it ll keep the doghouse warm but the temperature wont be so hot that it ll be uncomfortable for the dog .
28591	10	light gray this will make it so the dog will not get so warm inside the doghouse .
28592	10	white white because it will keep the doghouse an average of 42 deg c .
28593	10	white it would affect it because the lighter the color the less heat it absorbs so the cooler the dog will be . i know this because in the experiment the color white had the least at 42 deg c
28594	10	white if they paint the doghouse white it will be cooler in the summer because light colors attract less heat .
28595	10	dark gray dark gray is the best answer because a dog doesn t want to be to hot or to cold and 48 degrees is a good temperate for a doghouse .
28596	10	dark gray dark gray because the dog has fur and the fur keeps the dog warm and the dark gray color is a little cold and a little warm . if the doghouse was black then the dog would get too hot . if the doghouse was white the dog would get too cold . dark gray is an average temperature .
28597	10	white white will affect the house because it will keep the doghouse cooler because lighter colors dont absorb much heat . if the color was black the doghouse would be hotter because darker colors absorb most heat .
28598	10	dark gray its kinda a dark color so the temperature in the doghouse can increase to 45 deg c .
28599	10	light gray why i picked light gray is because when the light shines on the doghouse it will have some sunlight in the doghouse but it will also have a little shade . another reason is when its dark out you will actually be able to seethe doghouse unlike when its black you cant seethe doghouse at all .
28600	10	white white because it would be much cooler in the doghouse because black attracts more heat energy from the air
28601	10	white white is the best choice because in the lid vs air temperature we found that when we had a white lid on the jar the jars air was the coolest out of the three other choices this can help b case when its sunny outside then the doghouse will be cooler flowing the dog to be in ana comfortable informant
28602	10	dark gray in the summer dark grey wouldnt be as cool as white paint but cooler then black . in the winter it would be a lot warmer than white though not as warm as black . in the experiment dark greys average air temperature 48 deg c was the average between whites average air temperature 42 deg c and blacks air temperature 53 deg c . also dark greys results were consistent throughout the trial staying at 48 deg c . therefore the doghouses temperature would probably be more consistent year round with dark grey paint than with white black or light grey paint which were less constant .
28603	10	light gray the light gray color will keep the doghouse at a manageable temp . it wont be to hot or to cold . the lighter the color the cooler it will be . the darker the color the hotter it will be . light gray would bethe perfect color .
28604	10	black black because black attract sunlight 
28605	10	light gray i think that the best color for the doghouse is light grey because it wouldnt get too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter .
28606	10	white painting the doghouse white would decrease the amount of heat absorbed inside the doghouse . this is because light colors reflect sunlight away more than darker colors like black and black absorbs light more than lighter colors . the experiment proved that darker colors absorb more heat and increase the inside temperature of the object .
28607	10	white there are many breeds of dogs but some are better in colder weather than warmer ones . for these types of dogs they should have a white doghouse to keep the dog cool in the hot summers . on average the white color was 11 degrees cooler than black color .
28608	10	light gray this will make the doghouse cooler in the summer than dark gray paint and black paint and it will also keep it warmer in the winter than the white paint .
28609	10	white i would paint the doghouse white . the reason i would do this is because it will keep the doghouse cool inside because it doesnt absorb much energy . if you look at the data table it show that the lighter the color the cooler it is inside . it also shows that white absorbs less energy than the other colors .
28610	10	light gray a darker color absorbed more heat then alight er color . which is why light gray would be a good choice . in the winter it could absorb a good amount of heat to keep the dog warm . and in the summer keep him cool .
28611	10	white the white doghouse would keep the doghouse colder then the other doghouses . the data table shows that anything black also robes more light because the temperature average is 53 deg c and the temperature average for white is 42 deg c . also dogs have fur so they dont need to be warm in the winter .
28612	10	white it wont get too hot inside . according to the data table the white lids temperature was the least compared to all of the other colors .
28613	10	white it would give the inside of the doghouse al lighter effect .
28614	10	dark gray so that the house count be that hot nor cold in the center or too hot in the summer .
28615	10	light gray i think high gray would be a good choice because if it was hot out te dog wouldnt get to hot and if it was cold out it wouldnt be to cold .
28616	10	dark gray this color will absorb some heat but not a lot so it will be good in winter and summer
28617	10	white if you were to paint a doghouse i would paint it white because the data shows that white had the lowest temperature out of all of the colors of the jars . so the dog doesnt get too hot if it were painted black .
28618	10	black black color would be good because it absorbs all the light and keep the doghouse warm
28619	10	light gray the color will make it so the dog doesnt have to much heat but a little bit of heat so that the dog doesnt get cold during the winter if he is outside
28620	10	black black had the highest average temperature ensuring that the dog would stay nice and warm . the average black temperature was 53 deg whereas the average white temperature was only 42 deg leaving an 11 deg difference .
28621	10	dark gray i chose dark gray because it would keep the dog house reasonably warm without getting to warm . i also think it would be warmer in colder climates and not as hot as black in warmer climates .
28622	10	light gray because it is not a dark color so it wouldnt be too hot in the doghouse plus it is not completely light so it wouldnt get too cold .
28623	10	white in the summer the dog will not be as hot because the white point will reflect the sun .
28624	10	light gray i would paint the doghouse alight gray because its a color that wont attract to much sun so that in the summer the dog has a place togo where he can be cool and feel refreshed .
28625	10	black it wont be able to see it en the night
28626	10	light gray if i were to build a doghouse with the paint color according to brandi and jerry s experiment i would chose the color light gray to use for many reasons . first because it reflects the sun enough to stay cool but it still has the pigment to absorb the color .
28627	10	light gray i chose light grey because it wouldnt get to cold or to hot for the dog .
28628	10	white this will keep the doghouse cooler inside to keep the dog from overheating in the summer .
28629	10	light gray code 98745 16956 666577810 123456789 10 code 
28630	10	white the color white will keep the doghouse cooler then any other darker colors .
28631	10	white white might affect the temperature in the doghouse because in the results it shows the color white has the least amount of heat so if you wanted to keep your dog more cool brandi and jerry should use the color white .
28632	10	light gray the best paint color would be light gray because according to brandi and jerry s experiment the air inside the jar would measure to 45 deg c after ten minutes . although the starting temperature may vary the average of 45 deg c is reasonably warm fora dog as to keep it comfortable .
28633	10	light gray alight gray color would be perfect fora doghouse because the average temperature of air inside the jar was 45 deg c . this temperature is in the middle of too hot 53 deg c or too cold 42 deg c . the dog would not get too hot or too cold in the doghouse . 45 deg c is a temperature that dogs would love . therefore the light gray color would bethe best choice to paint the doghouse .
28634	10	light gray light gray might have a affect on th doghouse because in the summer it wont attract the sun and it wont heat up as much as a dark doghouse .
28635	10	white they should paint the doghouse white because if it is white it is more likely to stay at a cooler temperature . if the doghouse was painted black it would have the highest temperature of 54 deg c while if you paint the doghouse white it would have a low temperature of 41 deg c . that is why they should paint the doghouse white .
28636	10	white this color will affect the inside of the doghouse because if it is a black lid or doghouse it is going to be really hot inside of the doghouse because black attract the sun but if you were to have it be white it would be a little cooler because the sun isnt as attracted to white as black . like they did in the experiment with the black lid on the jar and the temperature was rising faster than it would with the whit lid .
28637	10	white white might affect the inside of the doghouse because when its hot out and the sun its the doghouse it will be cooler in there the nit will be outside . darker colors absorb more heat energy then lighter colors .
28638	10	black black is the best color to use to paint the doghouse because it will keep the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors . in the glass jar experiment the jar with the black lid was warmest at 53 deg c compared to 48 deg c 45 deg c and 42 deg c .
28639	10	white white will effect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler . in the experiment the with color had the lowest temperature 42 compared to the other colors .
28640	10	black the color black can absorb all the colors and make it hot in their for the dog .
28641	10	white so there would be lest heat energy in the doghouse 
28642	10	dark gray the dog will want to survive the winter but not be burning up in summer so dark gray can do both of these things
28643	10	black if they paint the doghouse black it will be warmer inside because it shows in the experiment that the darker the color lid the higher the temperature inside the jar was . in the data the average for black was 53 deg c and the average for white a lighter color was 42 deg c . this shows that if they painted the doghouse black the dog inside would be warmer .
28644	10	white using white as the color of the outside oft he doghouse will keep the doghouse cooler than if the color was black . according to the data chart the glass jar with a white colored lid on stayed cooler than when the glass jar had a black coloured lid .
28645	10	white if the doghouse is a different color then it might be hotter or colder . like if the dig house was black then it would hot like in the experiment blacks average was 53 degrees calcium . white was an average of 42 degrees cells . darker colors attract more light .
28646	10	light gray i chose light gray because on a warm day it will deflect some of the heat and on cold days when the sun is up it will keep it a little bit warm .
28647	10	dark gray because its a dark color but not to dark for summer so its not too hot .
28648	10	white white would make the doghouse warm but not too warm so that the dog overheated and not too cold that it would freeze . if you used black within 10 minutes on a hot summer day the doghouse would reach 54 deg c in which the dog would probably get way too hot . white would be better for the dog since it had the lowest ending temperature . if you used white it would only get to about 42 deg c which is a reasonable temperature fora dog .
28649	10	white color of white will help the dog stay cool on a hot sunny day
28650	10	dark gray it would not really affect the color right away it would take awhile for it to change .
28651	10	black if you paint the doghouse black the doghouse will be warmer because black attracts heat . the data proves that with temperatures at 54 52 54 and 53 . all the other colors are in the 40 s . so choosing black will help the dog stay warm .
28652	10	white white will absorb the least amount of heat into the doghouse .
28653	10	black
28654	10	white it would not absorb as much energy if it was white so it would be cooler inside a white doghouse rather than a black doghouse . for example the average temperature inside the black doghouse was 53 deg c which is really hot while the average temperature inside the white doghouse was only 42 deg c which would be better fora dog .
28655	10	light gray alight gray color is good because by looking at the trials that color was in the middle so not to hot not to cold . the dog is not going to be hot on a sunny day it will be just right .
28656	10	dark gray the dark gray color could affect the doghouse by keeping the temperature inside of the doghouse the same throughout its use . in the experiment the dark gray lid kept the temperature the same throughout each of the trials .
28657	10	white it would effect the doghouse by making it cooler than the other colors would because in the experiment the jar with a white lid lighter color had an average of 42 deg c while the darkest colored lid black had an average of 53 deg c .
28658	10	light gray i chose light grey because the color doesnt get as hot yet not to cold .
28659	10	dark gray the dark gray roof will keep the doghouse the same temperature . for when brandi and jerry used a dark gray lid the high data for it was 48 deg c and the low was 48 deg c .
28660	10	white by painting the doghouse white the doghouses air temperature will be lower . the jar with a white lids temperature was 42 deg c and the jar with a black lid was 53 deg c . the white jars air temperature was 11 deg c cooler than the black jar .
28661	10	white it will make it cooler in the summer .
28662	10	dark gray i chose dark gray because that way it will keep the dog warm in the winter but not too hot in the summer it had an average temperature of 48 deg c the darker the color the more energy taken in
28663	10	light gray i choose this color because if the doghouse was a dark color it would absorb more heat and if the doghouse was to light it would be to cold so if you do a medium color it wouldnt be to hot or to cold it would be just right
28664	10	white white because white can defense from the sun
28665	10	light gray if u use black then it will get real hot in the sun so your better off using light gray
28666	10	black black would affect the doghouse by being very hot inside all the time and the dog might not like that .
28667	10	black if the doghouse is painted black i think that the doghouse will get the more heat deg c because the average of the c color black for min ina glass jar was 53 deg c .
28668	10	light gray light gray might effect the doghouse because in the spring and summer it wont get to hot and in the winter it wont get to cold .
28669	10	black i would use the color black for the paint color for the doghouse because it will keep the dog warmer . the average temperature was 53 deg in the jar that 5 more degrees than dark gray 8 more degrees than light gray and 11 more degrees than the paint color white .
28670	10	black this might affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse warm and the dog will be warm . because the temper re for the black was 53 deg f .
28671	10	light gray i chose light gray because you dont want your dog to be to hot or to cold
28672	10	white the white wont absorb as much light as the black keeping it cooler for the dog .
28673	10	white the color white will make cooler inside of the doghouse because white had the lowest temperatures such as 42 deg c and 41 deg c . when the color black had temperatures of 54 deg c and 52 deg c
28674	10	white the reason i picked this color is it does not prove as much heat . and the dog is ally in their to keep away from the hot sun or the to got bed but with the color white it can do both of these thing and still stay col
28675	10	black i think the color black would make the dog house hotter because black attracts more heat to anything that its on and that why i think black would be a horrible choice fora color . also in the table that brandi and jerry produced the color black has the the highest g percentage of of heat and the average heat of black was 53 . 25 deg .
28676	10	dark gray so i said dark gray because black will be too hot in the summertime because darker colors absorb more heat . the dark gray seems like a good choice because this color will not be too hot on a hot day .
28677	10	dark gray the darker the lid color the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar so i chose the color dark gray . this color might affect the inside of the doghouse by increasing the air temperature into a cooler hotter area for the dog to stay in but the temperature would be about 48 deg c which is a good air temperature of a doghouse and it ranges in the middle of 45 deg to 53 deg because black with the average of 53 deg c would be too cold for the dog to stay in .
28678	10	white i would say white paint would be best for the doghouse because its the color that least absorbs energy . if you want to save money i would suggest white because its saving your money and energy . they mentioned that darker the color the more energy absorbs . the doghouse would be not that warm if it was white . there would be more light if it was black but less light if it was white .
28679	10	black black will change the color because if its sunny outside it would be barker and hotter cause the sun attracts more then the other colors . as seen on the results . the average was about 53 deg .
28680	10	black it will absorb the heat for your dog
28681	10	white the white color will cause the inside of the doghouse to be cooler than the other colors . as seen in the experiment it would be on average 3 deg cooler than alight gray one 6 deg cooler than a dark gray one and 11 deg cooler than a black one . white would cause the least heat inside the doghouse out of all the available colors .
28682	10	white if you pick a dark color it will absorbs more light and white reflects the light .

2230	1	a procedur is expos to be show you how to do thi experi . the experi is miss a lot of thing . for exampl the first thing save in thi procedur is determin the mass of four differ sampl . that should not be the first step in the procedur . it should be to gather the materi tell you how to set up the materi . it should tell you what differ liquid that should be place into each contain and what to rabbl on the contain . it should tell you the size of the contain to . it should tell you what temperatur the room should be and how much of the solut should be place into the contain .
2231	1	after read the group procedur these piec of inform thei would need to includ in order for me to replic the experi ar p . in thi procedur thei need to be specif with which sampl their talk about . on need to see that to the procedur the sampl ar marbl limeston wood and plastic . p . the student need to includ how mani gram of each sampl of each substanc ar need . p . the student need to includ what type or kind of vinegar thei ar us . differ type could lead to sourc of error which could effect the final outcom of the experi .
2232	1	the inform you would need to know to replic the experi ar how much vinegar to put into the cup with the sampl . also what size cup to put the vinegar and sampl in . lastli you would need to have a constant place for them to sit for hour so you would need to know the temperatur of the room as well as vinegar . all of these thing could potenti affect the experi .
2233	1	there ar at least three thing miss from the instruct . first how much vinegar do you pour into the contain what is the size of the contain . and what do we us to measur the mass of the sampl these ar three of mani problem need correct .
2234	1	i would need to know were thei left the sampl for hour . depend on the climat there it can affect how it behav . i would also need to know how much vinegar wa pour into each contain depend on how much can affect the mass of each sampl . on more thing that i would need to know to replic thi experi would be if ani of the sampl were lash out or remov from the contain when wash each sampl with distil water that would affect the end mass a lot .
2235	1	in order for me to replic these experi thei would need to includ the name of the sampl in their procedur . thei would need to includ that need to find the mass of the sampl befor i begin the process and veri need to includ that i would need to find the differ of the begin and end mass in gram .
2236	1	to do thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar wa need in each of the contain . where would the contain be hous our exposur to such can caus a valid error . also miss off the sampl creat a valid issu . the sampl should be mass again when thei come out of the contain . what kind of contain
2237	1	to replic the experi we would have to know how much vinegar in each contain . thei would need to name each of the materi . explain to put each materi into a differ continu that wa fill with vinegar .
2238	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain . also i would need to know what temperatur to keep the contain in and how big each contain need to be that i wa put the sampl and vinegar in to .
2239	1	i will need the inform about how thei determin the mass of the four differ sampl and how much vinegar thei pour in each contain . also what type of vinegar .
2240	1	first i would need to know how to get the initi weight of each substanc . next i would need to know how to find the miss mass i would need to know mayb what kind of contain thei were or what size thei had to be . i would final need to know where the sampl should sit .
2241	1	to replic the experi thei should list what sampl you have to us that you have to find it end mass and the differ between both mass . thi should come after step in .
2242	1	the addit inform i would need is start mass count mass and differ in mass .
2243	1	to complet thi procedur thei should have given the amount of vinegar and the size of the contain . thei should have also said what sampl to us and what to label them . thei could have even ad in how to determin the mass .
2244	1	in order to replic the experi the procedur must includ what four sampl we would be test . anoth kei part is identifi how much vinegar is in need to put in the contain which decid the variabl . other mistak includ the variabl need to be identifi so that we know what ha to affect the other in order for it to be a product experi .
2245	1	there ar few addit piec of inform need in the procedur . first of all the procedur should includ what kind of
2246	1	to replic thi experi you would need larger amount of the sampl .
2247	1	if you want to replic thi experi you would need to know what kind of vinegar wa us how much vinegar wa us and what materi of contain wa us . you would need to know thi in order to keep the experi constant .
2248	1	the addit inform i would need is how big each sampl is like in width and height so thei ar all equal . also i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain without these fact the experi could turn out wrong becaus everi sampl ha to be control in in order to receiv the correct inform .
2249	1	after read the group procedur the follow thing would still need to be ad the first would be the type of contain thei sai it should be separ but ident but thei should list how larg it should be also thei should add how much vinegar is need in each contain to keep the experi constant to the experi to make sure that thei ar accur result .
2250	1	to conduct thi experi properli thei would need to includ the type of contain how much on sampl of the substanc is and what the substanc that is be test is . without thi import inform the experi could not be properli redon with accur result .
2251	1	after read the group s procedur i determin that the addit inform need in order to replic the experi is the exact measur of vinegar to put in each of the four singl contain determin the differ in mass between befor and after and label the contain . the addit inform explain abov will all help to replic the experi .
2252	1	on piec of inform is how larg ar the contain second what is thi for and three why doe it need to be separ but ident contain . that doesn t mack much scienc .
2253	1	wood is the answer becaus wood take vapor
2254	1	the addit inform you would need to replic thi experi is the amount of the for sampl you ar us that take test on the amount of vinegar us and how much is put into each contain . also you would need to know the specif of how much is us either gram militari etc . you would also need to know how much water you us to rise off sampl and how larg the contain were to what their mass wa .
2255	1	to replic the experi precis i would need addit inform on how much vinegar thei us which type of vinegar and what the temperatur of the vinegar wa .
2256	1	the addit inform that is need in order to replic the experi would be p . how much vinegar is pour in each of the four contain . p . which sampl had the highest mass differ after the procedur and which had the lowest chang . p . all the sampl would have equal the same mass at the begin of thi procedur .
2257	1	accord to the group s procedur there is addit inform that you would need in order to replic the experi . first the would need to sai the four differ sampl marbl limeston wood and plastic . secondli thei did not tell us how much vinegar we need to us . lastli how much of each sampl ar we suppos to us
2258	1	after read thi group procedur thei could have ad the type of invit to place in which sampl .
2259	1	first of all i would need the problem of the experi state so i can state . i would also need the amount of vinegar state so all cup can be even . i would also need what type of vinegar wa us .
2260	1	in order to replic the group experi the addit inform you need to saw is what the sampl were how much vinegar is us and how to measur the four differ sampl you need to know what the sampl were in the experi becaus you need to know what to us when your repeat it so you cant just us anyth . you need to know how much vinegar is us for a repeat experi . final you need to know how to measur the four differ sampl to get the right and accur data .
2261	1	addit inform i would need in order to replic the experi is what the sampl ar how to find the mass of a sampl and how long to rins each sampl for .
2262	1	you need to put an equal amount of vinegar in each sampl . you also should test would a littl longer to see if it realli doesn t loos ani mass if an acid sound it .
2263	1	in order to replic thi experi i would have to know how much vinegar i need to pour into each of the contain . in order for thi to be reliabl i would have to us the same amount of vinegar . the amount of vinegar could effect the differ in mass of each sampl . i would also need to know what i am label on each contain . i would also need to know how long to rins each sampl .
2264	1	base on the student procedur i would need to know what the four sampl ar how much mass per sampl and the amount of vinegar pour onto the sampl . other us inform would includ temperatur and size of rock for the sampl .
2265	1	for thi procedur i would need to know the amount of vinegar . i would also need to know more inform of the materi . in the procedur thei also should of been specif in how mani time you had to repeat it .
2266	1	record the start mass and end mass then solo tract the two mass . to find the differ in mass . the four differ sampl ar marbl limeston wood and plastic . creat a data tabl with sampl start mass g end mass g and differ in mass g and record the data in the tabl .
2267	1	in order to replic thi experi on would need to know how much vinegar thei need to pour into each of the contain . on would also need to know the method by which thei should calcul the mass of the sampl befor and after the experiment pressur . thirdli on would need to know what the differ sampl to detest were . these veri import item were not includ in the procedur .
2268	1	where did the rain come from in the first place how much water is each contain
2269	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need what four thing ar be sampl how much vinegar to put in each sampl so i don t put too littl or too much . also i d need to know how much of each materi i will need to put in the four ident contain .
2270	1	in order to replic the procedur we could need to know how much amount of rain have fail onto the sampl and how strong wa the acid rain becaus it seem that the limeston wa mostli affect when the other sampl wa least affect .
2271	1	the procedur that the student come up with can not be easili replic . there is no list of materi that need to be gather for thi experi . there ar also construct al error . it would be help to have constant in the experi or thing that ar kept the same through all sampl such as how much vinegar to put in the cup . there is also constant or sampl that the other can be compar to such as a sampl place in water versu vinegar .
2272	1	some addit inform that you would need is how much vinegar would you need to put in each contain . anoth piec of inform that you would need is where would you put the sampl for the hour . would if a in a refriger of on a counter . the last piec of inform that you would need is what would be in of the water that you ar wash the sampl in would the water be hot warm or cold .
2273	1	the addit inform need is a control variabl . thei need to state what materi wa put in first how thei determin the mass what kind of a contain their talk about and wa there ani thing in those contain .
2274	1	other addit inform that you would need to know to replic thi experi is what sampl to us how much of each sampl and how much vinegar to poor in each cup .
2275	1	the addit inform that i would need in the procedur would be what materi i would need to do the experi . then i would need to know how much vinegar to put in the four contain . final i would need to know . i would need to know the start mass of each sampl .
2276	1	five piec of addit inform would be to what you would measur the sampl with whether it be a scale or someth els . p . how much vinegar to put in each of the contain . p . whether or not the amount of vinegar is constant in each of the four contain and is where to put the sampl the hour it is left experi and suitor it be in a fridg somewher cold the sun somewher hot or room temperatur .
2277	1	on thing i would need to know is how much vinegar goe into the contain . anoth thing is how much of each substanc would go in the contain what temperatur should the liquid vinegar be to what temperatur do we let the sampl dry
2278	1	in the procedur the student should have start by ad which ho trial thei were us so that somebodi els could actual replic the experi when pass the vinegar no specif chang were written which could chang the end result . it would have also been help if the student explain what the start mass of each materi wa .
2279	1	in order to repeat thi experi on would need addit inform . on thing would be to know how much vinegar to measur out . anoth would be to know the size of the addit contain . lastli on would need to know how much distil water to rins with .
2280	1	the student should have put how thei dri the sampl and if thei put it on someth put what it wa . also should have had the amount of vinegar thei us .
2281	1	some addit inform that is need is how much vinegar wa ad to the contain . anoth piec of inform need is ar the sampl materi all the same size you would also need to know what temperatur the materi were held at for the hour time period .
2282	1	on thing the group could have done wa concentr on a specif sampl such as marbl then state the other as sampl . mean thei could have said for step . put a marbl sampl into a contain with vinegar and label . repeat . . . thei also did not specifi neither how big the contain were nor how much vinegar to pour in .
2283	1	after read the group procedur in order to replic the experi you would have to find out which sampl goe with which mixtur to make the sampl replic with anoth .
2284	1	the student would need a clear statement of the problem . thei would need to explain why thei were determin the mass of four sampl thei also would need a hypothesi thei should explain what thei think their experi will turnout . final thei need a conclus tell what happen at the end of the experi .
2285	1	in the inform you would . the mass g start with the wood stranger then the plastic that have more . then differ in mass o . i .
2286	1	in the procedur we would have to know what sampl we ar test . also if each exampl wa p start at the same mass . in the step it just sai pour vinegar . we need to know in exact amount to have each contain the same that could be a factor that would set off the experi .
2287	1	someth els you would need to add to thi procedur is how much liquid wa put into the contain . also the thing that you need in order to do thi procedur .
2288	1	some extra inform that you would need wait be what ar the four differ sampl how much vinegar do i pour into each contain how big ar the contain and how much distil water do i us to rins with .
2289	1	in order to replic thi experi the group would have to put what kind sampl i would be put in each contain becaus i could put ani kind of materi in the contain instead of what the group put which would make our data complet differ . the group should indic how to determin the mass of each sampl after it sat in the vinegar . most importantli thi group need to indic what thei us as a control in their experi becaus thei need to compar acid rain or vinegar to normal the normal eros of the sampl when it is rain on with common everydai water .
2290	1	to replic thi experi we would need to know what each sampl ar and how much of each sampl goe into the contain . the procedur also must state that we record our data after each measur and the procedur should specifi how much vinegar goe into each contain . the last step of the procedur should tell us to subtract the start and end mass to determin the differ in mass .
2291	1	the addit inform that i would need is the type of mass i would also need to know on what ar factor i need to put the mass i would also need to know what subject i am go be us . i would need to know how much vinegar i would need to put in the contain .
2292	1	addit inform i would need in order to replic thi experi would be . a control sampl should had ben part of the prosper . i detest the experi take be for result . would also need to test the ph of the vinegar .
2293	1	we need to know what ar the four sampl . how much of each sampl we need what unit to measur how much vinegar to pour in each cup and what word you label the cup .
2294	1	some addit inform that would be need to replic thi experi is the amount of vinegar us . anoth thing that would be need is a set set start mass for each sampl b c then everi time you replic the experi the same mass of the sampl is us the result can be compar . the group should also clearli state the sampl us in the procedur that wai the experi can be replic .
2295	1	well i think that when thei move the mass from on contain to anoth contain there is when everyth start chang with the temperatur when we remov it it get an a differ size .
2296	1	the group procedur run act . wage and final rest
2297	1	to replic thi experi i would need to know exactli how much vinegar should be turn into the contain so that each contain can have the same amount of vinegar . i would also need to know what type of instrument wa us to measur the mass of each rock so i would be abl to us it to measur the start weight and then add the same and when measur the end weight .
2298	1	in addit to the procedur there ar mani more specif step . thi group of student would have to includ . step number talk about pour vinegar into contain but thei did not includ how much vinegar to put in each contain . so be more specif would make the experi more valid . in step it sai to rins with distil state how much water would be a better choic have a content would help the student improv the mass of the other sampl .
2299	1	in the procedur thei didnt explain it right becaus thei left out mark the four sampl the didnt label the contain to let us know pacif alli .
2300	1	after read the procedur i would add to an the procedur step more time so you know that the experi is valid . also thei can us differ kind of water to see if it doe anyth to the mass .
2301	1	addit inform that you mai need in order to replic the experi might be the amount of distil water need to add . if you ar put a differ amount of distil water in each contain the result could not be accur . the differ in mass veri from . . . . thi would be inaccur without the proper measur .
2302	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know the amount of vinegar that wa suppli to each sampl becaus that must stai constant . i would also need to know how to label each contain and where to store the sampl for hour .
2303	1	. check if the sampl is differ . p . check if the sampl after more dai . p . then check all the sampl on to on .
2304	1	after review the procedur some addit inform that i would includ is what do you do after you not it it get for it mass . also what would you do befor you determin the mass of four differ sampl . furthermor what mass thei try to test .
2305	1	the group need to explain how determin the mass of the sampl in the first step . then thei need to put how much vinegar into the contain in step number two . final thei need to tell what the kind of contain ar be us such as size shape and materi .
2306	1	first and foremost i d need the materi if didn t know what it is that i m work with then how could i do it also the problem i need to know what i m try to figur out . on more thing that d be pretti us is the hypothesi . note to take their answer but compar it to mine and see where both our head ar at .
2307	1	you will need a control you could also figur out witch substanc had the most least effect by us a ph meter .
2308	1	in thi procedur you would need the name of each sampl us identifi the mass of contain and to record data on a tabl .
2309	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know how much vinegar wa pour into each contain . you would also need to know what kind of vinegar wa us so you can us the same kind . lastli you would need to know what the student ar investig thei didn t includ a purpos . all of thi would need to be known becaus with out specif detail an experi can chang .
2310	1	to replic thi procedur you would need to know how much vinegar thei pour into each cup . also thei could show up how long thei rins the sampl for . it could chang the mass if thei did on longer than the other . final thei could have done a second test to see if there test wa correct .
2311	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar is be pour in each of the four contain step how much is a sampl of the materi be test how much of them should be put in each contain step and how you ar go to determin the mass of these depend variabl step and .
2312	1	i think that wood wouldn t be the best sourc for acid rain or plastic .
2313	1	thei should of includ what kind of contain the sampl should go in thei should of told you in the direct how thei want it measur the make of the tabl should have also been includ . also should of includ measur of the sampl .
2314	1	you need to add the averag weight of the mass befor start the experi . at first befor start . write your predict .
2315	1	you would need to know how much vinegar you need to us and also the concentr of vinegar . final you would need to know the temperatur at which the experi should be perform .
2316	1	you would need vinegar you would need tabl to label the contain . and you would also need ident contain .
2317	1	in order to replic thi experi the procedur must be clarifi or should sai how to determin the mass and it should sai what the four sampl ar also in step it should sai how much vinegar need to be pour in each contain . in step it should be state what materi should be place into what contain also how it should be label .
2318	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contain . you would need to know which rock wa in which contain and you would need to know which rock is which .
2319	1	student should add an explan of why thei ar do thi experi .
2320	1	addit inform the person conduct the experi would need to includ and make sure each sampl of marbl limeston wood and pilot is the exact same weight refus be put into the vinegar . by have each scrape weigh someth differ the acid anoth ve naiv to the experi make the delia not precis .
2321	1	need to know what ar you us in order to get the mass . what you just count with finger . why do you need the sampl to sit not for hour . final what is all the materi that you ll need .
2322	1	how much vinegar do thei have to pour where do thei put the contain how do thei dry it do thei air dry it or do thei put it in a machin
2323	1	to replic thi procedur you would need the specif type of contain . the amount of mass would chang between contain . you would also need to know the amount of water us to wash fulli the vinegar . last you would need to know the amount of vinegar put in each cup for with more vinegar more rock could be erod .
2324	1	how much vinegar do we put in each sampl and is there a control variabl for thi experi . what kind of place do the sampl sit to get the best result . how much distil water do we rins each sampl with wouldn t that screw up the weight .
2325	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contain . you would also need to know if you should let the sampl dry insid the contain in hot air cold air insid outsid thing like that you would need to know to replic thi experi .
2326	1	addit inform i will need in order to replic thi experi ar place the four differ sampl into fare differ contain . tell what the four differ object ar obtain a marbl limeston wood and plastic . tell where you place the four differ mass to allow them to dry these step ar need for me to replic thi experi thoroughli .
2327	1	in order to repeat thi experi i would requir the control . nowher in thi experi doe it state me . asid from that i need to know how mani ml of vinegar to add me in what size contain . all these minor detail must also remain constant throughout to maintain valid . these should also be more trial to increas the experi accuraci and valid .
2328	1	in order to replic the experi you need to know what the sampl of materi thei ar us . also you would need to weigh each sampl at the start of the experi to find it start mass you would also need to tell us to find the differ in mass from the start to the end of each sampl .
2329	1	in order to replic the student experi thei would also have to describ the amount of vinegar thei put in each cup and keep it constant . the student should also record the temp of the vinegar and do o thei wash the rock in . also the student should of had more than on trial to make their data more valid .
2330	1	the thing you need in order to replic is to add more acid rain thei allow the sampl to sit and dry for minut .
2331	1	you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each jar you will also need to know what problem you ar try to solv . with out know the problem you have no idea what the data is for make it utterli useless .
2332	1	for thi experi the group could put averag the differ of the mass in the procedur record the start mass and write that thei record the end mass . thei left all these exampl out .
2333	1	the first thing i would need in addit to do the experi is first how or with what scale do i measur the sampl with . second what am i test must need the name of the sampl . third how much of the vinegar . do i put into the contain . fourth how much of the sampl do i put into the vinegar . all of those thing ar need is addit for do the experi .
2334	1	i would put how much of the vinegar you put into the contain . also how much mass it ha .
2335	1	in the procedur it doesn t specifi how much vinegar to us it also didn t specifi what type of sampl to us . it also doesn t can how much of each sampl to us .
2336	1	to replic the experi the addit inform that you would need would be what you need to know how much vinegar that you have to put in each of the four ident contain . and what kind of sampl and how much of each sampl .
2337	1	i would need to know the indec variabl the depend variabl the control variabl .
2338	1	after read thi group s procedur there is some addit inform i would need in order to replic their experi . first of all i would need to know exactli how much vinegar wa pour into each sampl . also i would need to know what temperatur or condit the sampl were store at while sit in the vinegar . lastli know the type of materi would be import in replic thi group s experi .
2339	1	for complet thi experi you might need to know exactli how vinegar is in the contain . you would also need to know the size of the contain and ie the vinegar is to complet be emerg the sampl . the area in the room would also be a sooth to know about
2340	1	inform that you would need to replic thi experi is a problem what the sampl ar and label for each contain .
2341	1	befor be abl to replic thi experi there is addit inform you would need to know . on major piec of inform that is not includ in the procedur is what the four differ sampl ar . thei would need to specifi marbl limeston wood and plastic . other inform thei would need add to the procedur what to put the substanc in becaus a contain isn t specif enough and how to measur the mass .
2342	1	in order to replic thi experi a few thing must be ad to thi procedur . for exampl the procedur should mention the four sampl thei ar us . also the procedur should be more specif in tell what kind of contain to us . lastli the procedur ask to measur the mass of the sampl but it should be specif in what unit of measur to us .
2343	1	first you would need to know what the materi were that you were soak in the vinegar . thei ar a marbl limeston wood and plastic . also you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain . final you would need to know what you were measur the mass of the object with .
2344	1	i would need addit inform to replic thi experi by know what textur to leav the contain in for hour . i would also need to know how much vinegar to put into the contain to start and how big the sampl item ar .
2345	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know what materi you would have no clue what materi you were us . you would also need to know the prepar to the experi just in case there were us danger object or substanc be us . lastli to be abl to replic the procedur you would need to how thei came up with the mass and differ in mass becaus there ar mani wai to get mass .
2346	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know where the contain of substanc were kept and if thei were expos to other element . also you would need to know where thei were left to dry after be remov from the contain . you need to know specifi such as if the contain . do you know which substanc you ar measur .
2347	1	i think it batter of with limeston becaus it will cell it saver than the oder staff .
2348	1	the group could have add the name of the sampl us in the experi to make the first procedur more dear thei also could have ad a characterist chang to look for in procedur . p the first list procedur could have been collect all materi the procedur could have also includ measur .
2349	1	in order to replic thi experi you first need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain . you would also need to know what wa the sampl on what kind of scale lastli it is necessari to know the light and temperatur condit you ar let the sampl skin .
2350	1	on addit piec of inform necessari to duplic thi experi is the volum amount of vinegar put into each contain . anoth piec of inform is the size of the contain to be sure to cover the whole materi with vinegar . also the type of sampl would need to be provid to duplic thi experi for exampl what type of wood mapl oak
2351	1	the group procedur could be improv by specifi what the sampl ar . until i read the result i did not know that the sampl ar differ type of rock . p the procedur could also be improv by ad the a control which could be do the same procedur but replac the vinegar with water . the procedur should also includ the amount of vinegar ad to the sampl .
2352	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know how much vinegar to us how big the sampl size were and if you can us ani materi not the on given . the size factor ar the most import becaus too much or too littl can caus the result to be incorrect .
2353	1	thei would have to includ the size of the contain size of the sampl how much vinegar how much distil water to rins them off with .
2354	1	i don t know how much vinegar to us p start mass ha no control p at what temperatur do you store the sampl
2355	1	an addit inform i would need in order to replic the experi is .
2356	1	on thing that you would need to do is state how much vinegar to pour into each sampl then thei could do the experi more than onc becaus sometim just on experi doesn t get it done . you want more so if it wa invalid onc you will have some valid number . also make sure the sampl ar kept at the same temperatur in the same environ so that doe not turn into anoth variabl .
2357	1	in order to replic the experi more step need to be ad to the experi . you would to clean your suppli gather brand new sampl and repeat the step .
2358	1	after read the group s procedur you would need to know what type of sampl ar need to replic the experi . also you must know how much vinegar must be ad into each cup sinc it would be a constant measur . also it would be help to know the temperatur need becaus temperatur can chang the outcom of the experi .
2359	1	addit inform that you would need to replic thi experi is the amount of vinegar pour in the contain the name of the four sampl us and where we should let the sampl dry .
2360	1	addit inform that you would need is how much vinegar you need . what size contain ar you go to us .
2361	1	on thing that would be necessari to know from the procedur is what we ar collect . it tell us to collect four differ sampl . i don t know what that mean . a sampl could be of anyth . next there should be a direct for collect a certain amount of the sampl becaus if the amount were differ then there would be two independ variabl . lastli
2362	1	if i were to recreat thi experi i would not the differ type of sampl that were go to be test secondli i would specifi the amount of vinegar that should be ad to the sampl s contain . lastli i would specifi what to us for the dry process such as a watch glass and also what apparatu i would be us to weigh the mass of the sampl .
2363	1	the addit inform need to replic thi experi would be what materi ar to be us . the procedur
2364	1	in thi group procedur on thing thei do not specifi is what four differ sampl and of what you ar measur . also thei sai report but ident contain . the group should tell us what size and kind of contain to us . anoth measur that is go to plai a huge role is how much vinegar and how much of each sampl ar put in the contain . those ar coupl attic thei should add to their procedur .
2365	1	in the procedur of acid rain the procedur doesn t name the sampl thei ar us . it also doesn t sai how much the mass is for exampl in thi case it s g . it also doesn t show the materi .
2366	1	addit inform that would be necessari to replic the experi would be what the problem is that we re try to solv . anoth import piec of inform would be specif what kind of sampl should be us and the last good and necessari inform would be what the control group would be a control group is alwai good for compar data and result .
2367	1	on piec of inform would be to repeat the step . anoth import inform you would us in order to replic the experi is to add more data tabl . lastli you would need to add anoth differ mass to the tabl .
2368	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know the type of sampl ar be us becaus in the procedur there is noth that tell me . also thei don t give detail such as how to weigh the sampl befor and after the experi . on more import thing is that i would need to know how much vinegar to place in each cup or the valid could be affect .
2369	1	you will need to know how much vinegar you put in each contain . you will also need to know what materi you will need to complet thi experi final you need to know what to do with your data after . for exampl analyz your graph .
2370	1	to prepar the experi i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cue i wall need to know how the measur the and mass into vinegar substanc . i would need to know how mani of each same thei us thei conclud the experi .
2371	1	the addit inform that is need to improv thi experi is you need the heat the vinegar so it is easi to compar to other experi you also need to know the hypothesi and independ variabl thei do not tell you the state forward . you need to tell the person that s go to replic thi what you ar true he to do .
2372	1	in thi group procedur thei should have includ a control . also thei do not state the amount of vinegar that should be ad to each of the contain . lastli thei should set at what mass each sampl wa at that produc these specif result .
2373	1	in order to replic the experi i need determin the mass of the sampl . i have to check the time and remov the sampl i . e from the contain . i have to wait for the sampl to dry for minut . i have to colleg the differ in mass .
2374	1	the addit inform i would need to replic thi experi is what sampl i should us . anoth would be how much vinegar i should pour into each sampl contain and what materi i would need such as to determin mass .
2375	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need the start mass end mass and differ in mass thei would need the time that wa for the sampl it can be by hour or minut .
2376	1	the three piec of addit inform i would need to replic the experi would be the start mass end mass and it differ in mass .
2377	1	in order for me to be abl to repeat thi experi thei would have to includ how much vinegar to put into each cup . what kind of contain and what weather condit to keep the contain in .
2378	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know what the four differ sampl ar what to label the contain and after the hour were to you remov the sampl from the contain .
2379	1	in the procedur the group need to add what kind of materi sampl thei ar us . thei also need to identifi how much vinegar thei ar ad to the contain . also what will you label the contain onc you have the vinegar materi in it all that need to be put in the procedur in order to replic the experi .
2380	1	in order to replic the experi thi procedur would need some addit inform . on piec of inform need is the amount of vinegar that the student pour into the contain . also the student should have ad what the four differ sampl were in the procedur . anoth piec of inform the procedur is miss is to record the mass . with these three addit piec of inform someon could replic the experi .
2381	1	there is not enough inform to replic the experi . on bit of inform i would need is the amount of each sampl in gram that is requir . i would also need the amount of vinegar to add to each sampl . ml . the sampl us ar also not express in the procedur but thei ar in the tabl . the size of the contain also matter becaus that would decid the area affect by vinegar . the type of vinegar what percentag is also need . also temperatur could have in affect and that is not express through the procedur .
2382	1	we would need the repeat inform to determin the mass right . we need the marbl plastic and wood .
2383	1	addit inform i would add is the environ it in .
2384	1	in thi experi thei could improv a few of the thing thei didn t includ . first of all thei didn t state how much vinegar thei ad to each of the humeru . thei also don t have a control in other experi so it would be better if thei had a control so that the could compar the result of the differ sampl to the control thei also could us us more trial and on if the result ar differ or the same as befor .
2385	1	you will need the mass of four differ sampl . you need to pour vinegar in each of four separ but ident contain . place a sampl of on materi into on contain and label . repeat with the other sampl .
2386	1	in step three the instruct need to be clearer thei should tell me to put each sampl into it own contain . also there were no measur given in order to replic the experi i would need exact measur of how much of each sampl i need to us . step four should also be split up to make the instruct clear such as y let the sampl sit for hour p . remov sampl from the contain p . rins sampl with distil water .
2387	1	well read the group procedur i found that thei miss some inform the inform i would includ ar the amount of verg pour into the ident contain next is the temperatur that the contain ar in . i would make sure that the temperatur is a steadi temperatur and i would also sai to includ the type of vinegar becaus their ar mani differ kind of vinegar so you would have to make sure it the same type .
2388	1	to replic thi experi you would need to know what the four sampl were and you would also need to know how big the sampl were when you put them in also you would need to know how much vinegar to put in to each cup .
2389	1	you would need the amount of vinegar in each contain . the amount of how much the contain weigh . also how much water you us to clean the marbl . when you start and when you finish the procedur .
2390	1	you would need to weigh the contain befor and after you would possibl need a calcul for find the differ in mass . you would also need to know how much vinegar to pot in each contain .
2391	1	thei need to be more specif on what to us for sampl . it doesn t specifi how much vinegar to us and it doesn t sai label all four sampl contain .
2392	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar to our in the separ but ident contain . i would also need to know what type of contain to us whether beaker or someth rins . lastli i would need to know how much distil water i would need to us as well as what instrument to us for measur mass .
2393	1	addit inform you would need would be how much vinegar you put in each contain . you would also need to know what sampl you would us becaus it doe not sai in the procedur . final you would need to sai for how long you would rins the sampl becaus each on ha to be ident done .
2394	1	the addit inform that the group should have ad is the amount of vinegar be pour into each tube . also thei should indic the amount of materi thei place in each contain . also the should have made the label more specif .
2395	1	you would need the same amount of each materi becaus in order to get the same data you need the same amount of everyth . p you need to figur out the mass of the object when you start and the mass of the object when it end . p the last thing you need to have is to make sure that each sampl is done at the same time otherwis it will be inaccur .
2396	1	in order to replic the group s experi you would need to determin how much vinegar that need to be put into the contain with measur so that noth get chang . also the sampl that the kid us all have to have the same start mass which would lead to the same end mass . and the children should all us the same type of vinegar and cup so that noth would chang becaus of how thei ar in the same test tool .
2397	1	thing that need to be ad is how much vinegar is pour . without thi everyon would get differ result . anoth thing is there a top to put on the contain it doesn t sai . also the last thing that thei forget to put is if the contain wa in room temperatur or hot . without know thi it could ruin the whole experi .
2398	1	some addit inform you would need to replic the experi would be what did thei us to measur the weight of the sampl and what unit wa it in what ar the materi that you ar suppos to pour in with the vinegar . and how much vinegar sampl you ar suppos to put into each contain .
2399	1	in order to replic thi experi addit inform is requir . on would need to know how much vinegar wa pour into each contain . also it would be necessari to know what type of contain were us . a list of materi would ensur accur replic of the s experi as well as descript about how to measur the mass of the materi .
2400	1	addit inform you would need to repeat the experi would be to identifi the amount of vinegar be pour into each cup and have the sampl weigh the same amount in the begin of the experi . the amount of vinegar is need so that is elimin as a variabl . the start mass should be the same so it is easier to compar and contrast on sampl to anoth record the temperatur of the sampl or even where thei ar place in the room would be help so you can determin if the temperatur in variabl and then you have the cloth to continu .
2401	1	to be abl to replic thi experi thei must includ how much vinegar to add . also at what temperatur the sampl should sit and dry and how to find the mass of each sampl .
2402	1	to replic thi experi you would need to know what the four sampl ar and how much of the four sampl . you would also need to know how much vinegar to us . you also need to know how big the contain you ar us to do thi in ar .
2403	1	addit inform you would need to replic the experi would be how much vinegar you put in the ident cup becaus without the amount of vinegar state that result of the experi wouldn t be accur nor would you be abl to replic the experi properli and effect . also you need to state how much sampl or how much of it will go into the contain otherwis the result will not be accur becaus you absolut get the correct mass .
2404	1	the procedur need to sai which sampl to us for the experi becaus it doe not sai what to put into the contain . also need to sai how much vinegar to pour in each contain . keep trash of dry effect to the substanc dure the hour .
2405	1	on thing you would need is .
2406	1	after read the group inform i realiz that in order to replic the experi thei would need to list what materi thei need . thei would also need to make their procedur more clear . anoth import step is to list now much vinegar need to be put in the contain .
2407	1	some addit inform that you would need would be that you would need to know how much vinegar you need becaus if you were slightli off in all of the contain marbl chang and limeston chang and wood did not chang but if all the vinegar wa same in all contain the affect could have vari differ .
2408	1	in the procedur thei should state the maximum amount of gram that on would us for thi experi or be abl to have all of them be about the same size . for the first part when it sai determin the mass thei should of realli said to mass the object on a scale . if you were to predict the mass calcul could lead to incorrect data . thei also need to state how much vinegar you will be pour into the contain .
2409	1	thi group doe not have a list of materi . i would like to know how mani peopl thought thi experi would be accur or not .
2410	1	addit inform fer the student procedur would be the result record the differ between each mass and your predict hen .
2411	1	in order to replic the experi addit inform that i would need is how much vinegar is in each contain and whether to us safeti goggl ar not . i might also would need an conclus to see what chang thei might have chang .
2412	1	the addit inform i would need in order to replic the experi is to know which order to do it in end and graph the experi . .
2413	1	follow direct do everyth carefulli . connect it right .
2414	1	ok well wood s wa the those mass and plastic had the less mass .
2415	1	i would need to know how much vinegar to put into each contain ar their drop amount of vinegar go into each contain . i would also need to know what wa us to measur the sampl .
2416	1	we need the group statement of the problem we have the procedur and the record data . we also need the conclus .
2417	1	after read the group procedur addit inform you will need to replic it will be all the materi what to measur their weight in and an exact conclus .
2418	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to determin the mass of differ sampl pour vinegar into separ but ident contain determin the mass of each sampl .
2419	1	to compet the experi we would need to know how much vinegar wa put into each contain . the size of the contain would also be import . other import inform would be to have a control rock .
2420	1	in order to replic thi experi mani thing ar need . the student
2421	1	to replic thi experi you would need to know what to us to weigh the sampl how huge of sampl to start with and to put each sampl in differ contain . you also need to know which kind of sampl to us .
2422	1	in order to replic thi experi we would have to be given an exact amount of vinegar to add to the four oper four ident contain also in order to make a replic experi we would have to be given the size of the contain us as well as the dimens of the four differ sampl . also it is import to know at what temperatur the interv were kept at for the hour .
2423	1	addit inform that would be need to replic the experi is the amount of vinegar for each contain . i would also need to know the start mass of each substanc . i would also need the exact temperatur at which the substanc should over the hour durat . all variabl ar need in order to have a reliabl outcom of the experi .
2424	1	after read the group procedur i would need to know what the sampl were how much vinegar to add and what kind of contain thei us in order to replic the experi .
2425	1	to be abl to repeat thi experi i would have to know what sampl to us . how much vinegar ha to go in each cup . also we need to know how to figur out the mass of each sampl .
2426	1	you would need to know how much of each sampl to put in the contain p you would also need to be told how to determin the mass p you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each sampl .
2427	1	after read the group s procedur i have realiz in order to replic the experi i would need to know the follow . i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the contain and how much of the sampl to us . i would also have to know how big the contain ar .
2428	1	what type ar the contain glass plastic
2429	1	what kind of contain ar how big were thei what were the sampl suppos to sit on while thei were dry
2430	1	in order to replic thi experi the student would have to includ the differ type of stone in their procedur therefor we don t know what their test . also the student should have given a precis amount of vinegar in each sampl otherwis the result mai differ . the student should have also done a control experi to compar their data .
2431	1	some addit inform that you need is to weigh the sampl befor place them in vinegar . you would also need to know how much vinegar you need to pair in the contain . also the name of the sampl that you ar us would be need .
2432	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need some more inform such as in the direct thei should or told ail of the differ sampl that i wa place in the contain . thei should have explain to me bout to determin to mass of the sampl . and in the procedur thei should have explain to me how much vinegar to pour in each contain .
2433	1	plastic after hour remov the sampl from the contain and rins each sampl with distil water .
2434	1	the inform the group could have includ is to no the name of the sampl the amount of vinegar amount of sampl . thei also should have includ which data to record on thi procedur by make the name of the sampl . their provid inform person know what thei ar experi on . also the amount of vinegar should be constant and be record along with the amount of sampl so when the reader compar the data thei will understand the differ in mass . the data us should be record period when the procedur doesn t explain so you can compar number after
2435	1	after read the group procedur i would add more step . step would be took organ the materi better . the nd step i would add would be to measur the amount of vinegar that s actual go to go in the cup .
2436	1	after read the procedur i would need a lot more inform to replic the experi . i would need to know what the sampl were what tool were need and what the object of the project wa .
2437	1	thi group mai want to includ more specif inform like how much vinegar thei ar go to us . in thi procedur thei sai pour vinegar which is not a specif amount also thi group mai want to explain how thei ar go to label their contain . lastli thei mai want to specifi the best wai to determin the mass of each sampl .
2438	1	i would add a cover to the contain . thi is becaus you never know what might fall into the contain . and if someth doe fall into the contain then it mai affect the result .
2439	1	after read the group procedur it would have been good for the group to explain why thei chose the materi us why marbl limeston wood and plastic . couldn t the group have us some other type of materi . also it would have been help to know what kind of contain and the amount of vinegar .
2440	1	for me to be abl to replic the experi i would need to know the size of the place of sampl that ar go into the vinegar . second i would need to know how much vinegar is need for each ad . third i would need to know the size of the contain that the vinegar and the sampl piec ar go to be go into .
2441	1	i would need to know mani sampl thar ar and how much vinegar i would need to pore into each sampl .
2442	1	in order to repeat thi experi i would need to have new sampl and other stuff . i would need to keep thi date .
2443	1	in order to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar to put in the contain . i would also need to know how big the piec of each sampl would be lastli i would need to know how much water to us to rins the sampl off with .
2444	1	to replic thi experi we would need to know what the group of student us as materi . thi procedur doesn t give ani measur of what thei ar work with how do we know what size to us it sai to pour vinegar into the contain but doesn t sai how much .
2445	1	addit inform that could be ad is anoth trial so the experi or ha someth to compar to and to check the valid of the result . also thei should state what the sampl ar in the procedur . anoth would be state how much vinegar should be put in the cup and how much the rock is submerg in it .
2446	1	to replic the experi i would need to know how to determin the mass of the folli sampl and what measur to us the group never tell what or how thei took sampl of thi is a kei piec of inform . i would also need to know what to do with the sampl after place them into contain . the group wa veri vagu when write their procedur and didn t go into enough detail .
2447	1	i would need to pour vinegar in each of four separ but ident contain . i would remov the sampl from the contain and rins each sampl with distil water . then i would allow the sampl to sit and dry for minut to determin the mass of each sampl .
2448	1	to replic
2449	1	the addit inform that we would need is realli noth becaus anyth is there .
2450	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know how much vinegar in each sampl what kind of sampl rock wood etc and lastli how big each sampl ha to be . if it ha more surfac area then mayb more will erod .
2451	1	in order to repeat thi experi i would need sever addit piec of inform . the first thing i would need to know would be exactli how much vinegar i should put into the contain . secondli i would need to know exactli how much distil water to us when rins the sampl . final i would need to know how much of each sampl to us . onc i obtain thi inform i will be abl to replic the experi .
2452	1	after read the group procedur i would need further inform in order to replic the experi . first of all i would need to know what the sampl consist of of what substanc it is . second when pour vinegar into each of the contain how much should be pour third i would need to know what type of contain i should be us throughout the experi by small test tube beaker glass . that is what addit inform i feel would be need if i were to replic thi exact experi .
2453	1	in order to replic the procedur there would be more inform requir p the student should sai how much sampl to put into a contain procedur no . p the student should record number data observ right after thei hour . p the student should make said what to label the contain .
2454	1	after read the group s procedur some addit inform that i saw wa need to replic thi experi were the four type of sampl what were thei . thei never state in record start mass and it end mass .
2455	1	to make thi experi better the group of student would need a control so for step and us water instead of vinegar . also there should be more trial to test thi experi at least three time to make sure their data is accur .
2456	1	after lead the group procedur describ what addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi . make sure to includ at least three place or inform sampl marbl ml and out limeston . . and . plate had . . and . .
2457	1	in order to replic the student procedur on acid rain . we need to know to know addit inform about thi experi like how much of each sampl we would need and also how mani drop of vinegar ana acid rain to put into each contain . also on other thing the could add in there procedur is sampl of what thei don t tell you what your sampl ar entitl you get down to the tabl .
2458	1	first you need to find the end mass and then you need to find the differ in mass . also you need to state which sampl you ar talk about .
2459	1	to repeat thi experi i would need to know the problem wa try to solv thi why a narrow few would be kept . i would also need to know how much vinegar to us in step c . it would also be necessari to know what ti us as sampl in step .
2460	1	on addit inform is what sampl is the student experi on two . how much vinegar is place in each contain . these what size contain is us . these ar addit inform the student did not includ to hi procedur .
2461	1	in order to replic the experi to see how accur your result ar at the end of procedur number you need to add step number state that you should repeat step to ar or two more time depend on the experi . also in the chat you can add more inform wa averag mass and total mass for all of the four type of sampl .
2462	1	to repeat thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour in each of the four ident contain . doe the amount of vinegar vari i would also need to know what materi . in should us sampl in should know that the materi ar marbl limeston wood plastic . lastli i would need to know what unit to measur each sampl s mass with . the procedur should let me know to measur the mass in gram .
2463	1	i will need to replic the experi . is the three sampl is marbl limeston wood also contain .
2464	1	in order to replic thi experi you would also need to know how much ml of vinegar to pour into contain . the step miss includ a step for gather all need materi find the start mass of each sampl and find the differ in mass .
2465	1	to complet thi experi thei would need to add more step . the group s never said how much vinegar to add in the contain
2466	1	the group procedur is veri vagu . for exampl in step it sai to measur the mass of differ sampl . the word sampl doe not clearli tell you to measur the differ rack . the same problem is shown in step the procedur sai place a sampl of on materi . . . the problem is that the materi could be anyth . anoth problem in thi procedur is that the group did not sai how much vinegar to put in each cup . you need that as a control .
2467	1	i think the addit inform that would need in order to
2468	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain . i would also need to know what kind of balanc thei us . final i would need to know how long the contain were to know if the sampl should be submerg under the vinegar .
2469	1	detail explan of why the experi is need . is action temp desir . how is the mass determin
2470	1	to replic thi experi accur you would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain . it would also be help to know what temperatur the vinegar should be when it be place in the contain . you would also need to know what size the sampl materi is .
2471	1	on clear statement of inform is with of them drop the most mass . two did thei make sure thei check it twice or over again . three wa there data correct i think so .
2472	1	i think that becaus marbl . is good a new end mass g . too .
2473	1	you need to have four differ type of mass . to make sure to pour vinegar in for ident contain for each type of mass you have to wait hour until you can drain out the mass from the water then you have let it dry for min . after that you have to determin mass of each sampl .
2474	1	you will need to know how much vinegar to put in the contain . you will need to know what kind of contain thei ar talk about . and mostli you will need to know what the group is test . and it would also be help to know what type of plastic wood limeston and marbl to us .
2475	1	quit clearli it is first import that the replic know what sampl ar be us . it should also be establish that the four separ ident contain ar remov dure the second weigh in order to get an accur mass . it is also import to indic how much vinegar is be pour over the four sampl how it is pour in drop or with a cup and what type of vinegar it is . addition the environ where the sampl ar to sit and dry should be specifi . is it in sunlight or is it in a darken room
2476	1	some addit inform that will be need is how much vinegar to pour what do you us to determin the mass of the sampl and what type of contain should be us plastic glass paper .
2477	1	addit inform i would need to replic the experi would be the amount of vinegar be pour into the contain to state the name of the differ sampl in the procedur and the exact size of the singl sampl . it would also be good to know what contain thei ar us and size of it .
2478	1	some addit inform i would need in order to replic would be after step determin the mass of each sampl sai that you must find the differ in mass of each sampl . anoth piec of inform that is need is the purpos of the experi . for exampl ar thei try to find which materi had the greatest decreas in mass after the vinegar soak or the least decreas .
2479	1	in order to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar to us how larg the contain ar and how long i should rins each sampl with distil water . without thi inform the result of the experi can be veri differ than the result of a replica .
2480	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know what the four sampl were there is no indic of what the sampl were until the data tabl but that is not in the procedur . i would also need to know how much vinegar to add into each contain if the amount b constant and also the size of the contain . in addit i would also need to know where the sampl were place what locat of the room etc when thei sat for hour . i would also need to know what the constant wa to make the experi more valid .
2481	1	. you have to tell how much vinegar you will need to put in each contain . p . didn t tell what kind of materi ind to need to put the contain . p . do the experi again to see if the record you got befor will be the same .
2482	1	thi group s procedur would need addit inform if it were to be repeat by anoth group . the type amount or sampl to be us the amount of vinegar to be us on each sampl and the locat that the sampl would be kept in temperatur rang . light etc . ar all thing that should be includ in the procedur .
2483	1	on piec of inform that i would need is the temperatur of the experi . how much vinegar would also be necessari i would also need to know what the contain ar made of .
2484	1	to replic thi experi i would need to know what temperatur the sampl were sit in and what temperatur the distil water wa .
2485	1	thi group procedur is valid but allow it to replic will be a problem . by ad multipl trial to the procedur the mass can be averag allow he abil to be replic for exampl by take three sampl of each materi then place in three differ mark contain you can take the averag and then have the abil to replic it properli
2486	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to includ in the procedur what materi you ar us specif not just sampl how much vinegar to put in the contain just becaus the contain ar equal doesn t mean that the amount of liquid in them ha to be and what condit thei ar dry under so that thei ar all the same to decreas the chanc of have more variabl .
2487	1	addit inform that i would need to copi thi experi is first i need to no how much vinegar need to go in each contain . second i need to know the four differ sampl of what . last i need to know the four differ sampl that thei have to us in thi experi . these ar the thing i need to no befor i can do thi experi .
2488	1	after read the procedur of thi group lab there were certain thing miss onc ar the amount of vinegar in each sampl . a net mass for each materi as includ of have from deaf amount have came . doesnt sai everi date as make a what . roll about partli . doesnt sai what materi on us .
2489	1	to replic the experi you would need to know what the sampl ar you would need to know how much vinegar to add to the contain and you would also need to know what kind of temperatur to leav the contain in so the experi work correctli .
2490	1	the addit inform i would add to thi procedur is first you have to start out with correct of what materi you need to collect and how much of each without thi you will have no idea what sampl you ar measur . also the procedur should includ a step to get and put on whatev safeti materi ar necessari such as goggl . the procedur also need to includ how much vinegar you ar pour into the contain is it kept lab you have no idea becaus thei haven t told you . there should also be step to observ and record your data becaus that is how you plot a data tabl . lastli thei need a step to clean up their work area .
2491	1	some addit inform that i would need to repeat thi experi would be the amount of vinegar that it would need to pour into each of the contain what ar the four sampl that i am suppos to be test . after place the sampl into the contain what should i label the contain as and after remov the sampl from their contain where should i place them p
2492	1	after read the procedur we would need to know a bit more inform . first of all i would have the sampl all be about the same mass . also the procedur should have state how much vinegar wa put into the case as well as the size of the contain . sinc later on we would like to know the averag amount of mass that we lost . we should includ multipl trial . thi student need a lot of improv but it wa good now he mention hour and min .
2493	1	on piec of inform you would need in order to duplic the experi is an exact amount of vinegar you should us . also you would need more inform on the sampl becaus w o the data tabl . i wouldn t have known what we were experi with . lastli you would need to know what kind and size of contain thei us .
2494	1	three piec of inform that would need to complet the experi is on how much vinegar do you put in the cup what is an hypothesi also how much of each substanc ar you us it is imposs to recreat without at least know how much vinegar you ar us i ounc or i gallon you can t redo the experi without it .
2495	1	in order for me to do project and receiv the same result i would have to know sampl i ll be us how much vinegar to us and what type of scale i would us .
2496	1	in order to do thi experi agil you would have to repeat
2497	1	in order to replic the lab you would need to know what size the contain is . would need to know how much vinegar water wa in the contain .
2498	1	the addit inform you need is the start mass of the four differ sampl the end mass and the differ in mass to replic the full experi .
2499	1	same addit inform you would need to replic thi experi is how much vinegar to pour into the contain with the sampl materi . anoth would be to state what the sampl materi ar and what thei consist of . final the size of the contain along with the temperatur of the room in which it will be sit for hour .
2500	1	the addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi is where ar thei gonna put the contain what type of contain what ar the singl sampl for i think that thi experi is gonna be hard to do becaus thei didn t explain the procedur that good .
2501	1	other inform i would need to replic the experi is how much vinegar put into each sampl . also i would need to know what sampl to us . and the last time i need to know is where do i keep the sampl overnight . in sunlight or no sunlight . at room temperatur or not at room temperatur .
2502	1	the addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi is measur how much vinegar in each sampl you put in and the the contain .
2503	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know what the sampl were that were place into the vinegar . you would also need to know how much vinegar each experi wa place into as well as you would have to know what type of contain you would need .
2504	1	in order to replic thi experi you should know the acid level that the vinegar ha . you would need to know the start mass end mass and the differ between the two .
2505	1	on line that should be number is to grab four separ but ident contain and label them with the name of the rock sampl . p anoth would be after us a tripl beam balanc record the mass of the sampl onc again and compar the differ in mass . p anoth would be in determin the mass of four differ rock sampl .
2506	1	after read the procedur the addit inform i would need to replic the experi would be what four sampl i should be test how much vinegar to put in each contain and what kind of contain to us . these ar import becaus thei would make the result easier to replic and ensur that i make no error when react the experi .
2507	1	we would need to know some more thing to replic the experi . we would need to know what the four differ sampl ar . we would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each and if it is differ for differ sampl . lastli we would need to know what kind of contain to put them in and if we should label them or not .
2508	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the contain . you would need to know how much of the sampl to put in the vinegar lastli you would need to know .
2509	1	you would need doubl of everyth which mean you need to have of everyth in order to have replic of the same thing . you need more of the ingredi so that you can make of each .
2510	1	you would need a hypothesi to start the procedur and a independ variabl . also a depend variabl and then you would just have to know the step
2511	1	you would need to know the start mass of each of the item so you can determin the end mass . you would also have to know exactli how much vinegar need to be put in each contain becaus if you put too much vinegar or too littl vinegar in the result of the experi could come out differ than the first time becaus the amount might affect the result . you would also need to know how long to leav the sampl in the contain of vinegar hour and how long the sampl need to sit and dry min .
2512	1	in order to replic the experi you would need four more differ sampl vinegar and four separ but ident contain .
2513	1	you would first need to see the mass of the complet experi . onc you what it is replic the experi and see if the mass result come out differ .
2514	1	you need hypothesi and write what happen after it sit for minut .
2515	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar is be ad to the contain what kind of contain ar be us shape size . i would also need to know how much sampl of the materi were be ad to the vinegar .
2516	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar wa pair into the contain in the begin it would also be import to measur the mass of the sampl after remov the sampl from their contain and befor rins them . for more accur result get the same mass of each materi would suppli better data .
2517	1	the student should includ how much vinegar to pour into each sampl of the four build materi . the type of vinegar should be specifi as there ar mani differ varieti of vinegar . the student should includ what temperatur the water should be as well as the condit of the room and the type of contain .
2518	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know the amount of vinegar ad to each contain . if you add onli a teaspoon and place a sampl in it your sampl want clean crate as much as a sampl drown in vinegar . also what type of wood would be us becaus there ar mani differ type . you would also need to know how mani trial thei did that wai you know if thei averag it .
2519	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar wa pour into the four contain becaus that could be anoth factor that you should know if you were repeat the experi . the temperatur ha an effect becaus the four sampl ar undisturb for hour . anoth piec of inform you would want to know is a control group to see how much the mass chang .
2520	1	in order to replic thi experi you ar go to need a suppli list suppli the procedur and a pen or pencil to record your data . p the suppli list will be necessari for when you go to bui the suppli and the suppli ar need to do the experi . the procedur will be essenti so you can replic the experi . final you would need a pen or pencil to record the data to make a chart .
2521	1	after read thi group procedur in order for me to conduct thi experi i would need more inform for exampl what ar the sampl i am find mass for . also i would need to know how much vinegar i would need to pour into the contain . as well i would need to know what to label the differ contain so i do not get confus or mix up the contain .
2522	1	you will need to have a hypothesi a statement and and list of what you us for thi lab .
2523	1	i would first fix the procedur becaus it doe not give enough inform . to determin the mass of the sampl we should know the name . it also doesn t clearli state how much vinegar he she pour in . i would also need to know what materi thei us a statement of the problem and a hypothesi .
2524	1	in thi experi the addit inform i would need i for to know why there is a differ in the mass of all and why didn t thei all stop the same like wood also to see which on ha an better advantag and a pictur or draw
2525	1	in order to replic thi group experi you would need to includ where the contain wa place for the hour . you would also need to know how big the contain that kept the object in wa . thei mai also want to includ how long thei rins the mass for and the temperatur at which the mass were kept for the hour . by includ thi inform you could successfulli replic thi group experi .
2526	1	if i want to do thi experi thei should have said in the beg to take out all materi and list all includ in the experi also thei should have had a clean up pass toward the end . it would be difficult to do the experi without all materi said to be and in the begin . thei also should have put the specif amount of water that wa place in the beaker .
2527	1	the procedur could be follow but how can we follow it when we don t know what materi to us . the procedur sai determin the mass of differ sampl but we don t know what type of sampl to us . we also don t know how much vinegar to us b c if we don t know the right at it might effect the sampl . lastli we need to know what unit we ar us to find the mass of the sampl .
2528	1	to fulli understand the procedur the reader would need to know what the four differ sampl when thei ar the follow of the experi also what no of vinegar an in loot kind of contain leg squar cylindr etc how long should the reader rins each sampl we should be know what thei us to measur the mass to ensur accuraci also what marbl limeston wood and plastic is a lot of need p inform all of which is measur to carri out an accur replic of the student experi .
2529	1	in order to replic the experi the procedur given would need to includ what ar the sampl their state mass whether in the begin the mass of all sampl ar equal . also the procedur would also have to includ how much vinegar is pour in the contain and weather the amount of vinegar is kept constant . keep the temperatur constant could also increas accuraci as well as perform multipl trial . also the amount of distil water and type of distil water should also be ad in the procedur to replic thi experi .
2530	1	in order to replic thi experi i need to know exactli how much vinegar to pour into the sampl . au when thei sai contain doe it have a lid or where do i put the contain . also thei would need to do the experi with water as a control to help compar the differ .
2531	1	to replic the group experi i would read to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup . i would also need to know how much of each sampl to put in each cup and how larg the contain need to be .
2532	1	determin the mass of four differ sampl separ but ident contain .
2533	1	in order to replic the experi addit inform would includ i . e make sure that the amount of vinegar wa equal for the four contain and also to be sure that the marbl limeston wood and plastic ar weigh the same while experi .
2534	1	the addit inform that i would need to replic thi problem is how much vinegar wa put into each cup if all the sampl were the same size .
2535	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know if you need to cover the sampl while thei ar bake in the vinegar . you would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain . final you would need to know to know how long to rins the sampl in distil water for .
2536	1	in thi procedur you need more specif inform to replic the experi . you would need to know how much vinegar is pour into each sampl becaus without know that you wouldn t be abl to replic the experi . you would also have to know what kind of concentr the vinegar ha becaus each vinegar is differ which could chang your result . you would also need to have all the differ sampl be the same size becaus without know the size of the materi you wouldn t get the same result .
2537	1	first off thei should tell us what the four differ sampl ar . thei should tell us how much vinegar to pour in all of the contain . thei should tell us what to label each separ contain and to put which sampl in which contain . lastli what you measur the mass of the sampl with .
2538	1	you would need to put time down after each materi so thei were all open at the same time also you would have to label each materi so you would not get each of them mix up .
2539	1	in order to replic thi experi there ar a few addit piec of inform need . the first is the amount of vinegar need in each contain you also need to know how much of each sampl is necessari . it should also be clear whether or not it is necessari to have the same amount of each sampl know whether thei need to be the same mass or size is crucial .
2540	1	in order to replic the group experi thei would need to specifi what the four differ sampl were that were be put into the vinegar . thei would also need to tell me about what size piec of cash sampl i should us so that thei would all be the same . i would also need to know how mani ml i should us of the vinegar .
2541	1	the must it how much vinegar thei us . thei should tell us how big the contain should be . thei should tell you what to label so you don forget land mix up .
2542	1	the group s procedur is miss a coupl of step . first off what sampl what ar sampl . can thi be con that need to specifi what materi will be us as sampl . second thei do not tell us to determin the differ between the start and the end mass of the object . and lastli how much vinegar and how much sampl should we us . all it sai is to pour vinegar into four cup it need to specifi how much vinegar should be pour .
2543	1	a great idea for addit inform could be the amount of vinegar that you pour into each sampl . the total of mass between the four sampl would have help to . it would ve gave the reader a better understand .
2544	1	to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in to the sampl i would also need to know what the sampl ar i would also need to know how to rins the sampl .
2545	1	the addit inform i would in order to do thi experi is how much vinegar i need to pour into each cup so i can be as precis as possibl what type of vinegar thei us so the experi can be the same and what type of contain thei us so i can be sure that the experi is done these .
2546	1	some addit inform you would need to produc . thi experi is the knowledg of at what temperatur environ the singl each sampl here consist how much distil water you must add to the sampl and how much vinegar to add to the sampl materi .
2547	1	to complet the experi you must know more thing to replic the experi . first of all you must know how much vinegar is put in each contain . you must also know the mass of the contain and the amount that each is wash with a distil contain . know that inform will make do thi lab easi .
2548	1	to replic thi experi i would advic and us the sampl with the most differ in mass to help get mg answer in which on wa the best us .
2549	1	on thing that the group need to add to the procedur in order to replic it is how much vinegar thei put in it . thei also need a control becaus without a control the test is not red out . thei also need to list the size of the contain thei also need to tell us the temperatur thei kept to at .
2550	1	for me to repeat thi procedur i would need to know how much vinegar do i pour into the four separ contain . i would also need to know how much of each sampl i us becaus it doesn t tell me it just give the name of the sampl .
2551	1	to replic the experi i would need to know the ph of the vinegar . i also would need to know what type of plastic and the speci of wood that thei us in their experi .
2552	1	there ar some thing thei left out in the procedur on thing wa how much vinegar to put into the contain how much of the sampl materi to put in each contain .
2553	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar wa pour into each individu contain . you would also need to know if it would be necessari to run a repeat trial as well as where you would store the contain in a hot place cold place separ altogeth etc .
2554	1	the student should be more pacif and state the amount of vinegar that should be pour in each contain also the student should state how big each contain should be anoth thing the student should state is how long the rock should be rins with distil water .
2555	1	the addit inform i would need is how much vinegar and a more specif explan of the contain then just ident . it would also be help if the told us what the differ sampl were .
2556	1	if you ar to plan on do thi experi you must find out the mass befor anyth is done than right after . who ever perform thi experi did not weigh the stone out befor thei were rins off . thi is critic becaus you do read thi inform .
2557	1	some inform that i would need would be how much vinegar is put into the contain i would also need to know if the vinegar wa cool or heat or room temp were their separ trial and is thi here a tabl of averag mass how acid wa the vinegar will mass of the materi affect how fast the vinegar corrod it
2558	1	you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each contain . also would need to know what the sampl ar that you you ar experi with . then you would need to know the date as you start with the mass becaus it never said to record the data .
2559	1	in order to replic thi experi complet you would need to know what the mass wa befor put the item in the vinegar you would also need to know how much vinegar is need in the beaker .
2560	1	. deal with thi lab experi addit inform that i would give would be the name of the materi us in each contain . . i would explain more of why certain item and or object wa us for exampl vinegar . besid pour vinegar in each cup what part did it plai in thi experi question like what wa vinegar suppos to do . e . t . c . . .
2561	1	the group do the experi didn t state the act of vinegar thei pour into each rock . therefor there data isn t accur . thi group also did not state a control variabl . the reason for the experi is to compar the result to anoth rock . thei also did not state what kind of water to wash it with . we wouldn t know if the water would affect the rock .
2562	1	in order to replic the group s experi i would need some addit inform . in step on i need to know what the sampl ar and how to determin the mass . in step two i must know how much vinegar to pour into each contain . in step three if never dandi that the rock sampl ar in three same contain as the vinegar .
2563	1	how big the contain should be becaus the vinegar might absorb more in a more condens environ . it is also necessari to know how much vinegar is need in each of the four contain . you would also need to know how big each of the sampl should be becaus the vinegar might absorb more if it is small .
2564	1	in thi experi thei need to sai what the ar put into the liquid . thei also need to sai what temp to leav it at . also what thei ar try to find out .
2565	1	to replic thi experi you need to know . p how as the contain should be . p what sampl materi do you have the experi base on . p re mobil of the end mass . p mass beam balanc .
2566	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know how to determin the mass of the four differ sampl . you would also need to know how much of the vinegar and other sampl to put in the contain . the size of the contain is also necessari inform in order to accur replic the experi . in the procedur you must also list the four differ type of sampl that you ar go to us in the experi
2567	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need a problem statement . i don t know what thei ar try to figur out . without thi knowledg if i do the experi the data collect will be useless sinc i wont know how to us it . anoth piec of inform i would need to replic thi experi is the amount of sampl and amount of vinegar . i don t know how much vinegar to put into each cup . also i must set start weight for the sampl . if thei ar not equal to start out the experi would have been chang . the last thing i would add is a materi list . thi would make it much easier to see what materi i would need for thi experi without it i would have to look for them and place them out of the procedur .
2568	1	you need to be sure that thei let it sit for minut and make sure thei left it sit in the vinegar for hour . plu you need thei put the same amount of vinegar in all materi .
2569	1	after read the group s procedur the addit inform that i would need in order to replic the experi would be the start mass of each sampl to be the same weight as the sampl in the student data . you would also need to know the ph scale of the distil water to see if it s an acid or a base . the third piec of addit inform would be to contrast or compar it to other form of acid rain .
2570	1	step on ask to determin the mass of the four sampl . thei should add what to us to weigh it and list the four sampl . in step two thei should tell us the amount of vinegar to pour . step three thei should ve made the sentenc repeat with remain sampl place a singl sampl into a singl contain . it s own step .
2571	1	to replic the student experi i would need to know what there control wa i also would need the depend and the independ variabl . i would need to know the type of cup thei us . i also need to know how much vinegar wa pour into the cup .
2572	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know what sampl i wa us the start mass end mass and the differ in mass .
2573	1	some addit inform i would need to replic thi experi would be what ar you sampl how much vinegar to pour and how much of the sampl should i put in the contain .
2574	1	in order replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar wa put in the contain at what temperatur the experi wa done at and what type of vinegar to us you would need to know thi inform increas the lab in a control manner that these thing were not specifi in the procedur .
2575	1	addit inform i would need to replic thi experi would be to know a what kind of vinegar that the peopl us becaus there ar more varieti and brand and to the contain should be ident . how am i suppos to know what type of contain thei us did thei us a graduat cylind a petra dish also in step number four of the procedur where it sai cycl after hour remov the sampl from the contain rins with distil water it should sai what temperatur of the water and for how long .
2576	1	in order to replic the experi on of the thing i would need to know is what you ar go to us to measur the mass secondli i would need to know after the sampl ar remov from the contain where thei ar go to be place in a separ contain . final anoth piec of inform i would need to know is the formula to find the mass
2577	1	addit piec inform you would need to replic the experiment state how you would determin the mass of each sampl . state where the sampl would sit and dry . and final state how much vinegar you would us . all of these thing will increas the valid of the experi .
2578	1	in order to properli replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar to add to each contain . also i would need to know what kind of tool wa us to put the sampl in and what kind of tool wa us to take the sampl out . in addit i would need to know what kind of materi were in the four contain also thei didn t specifi how thei determin the mass of each sampl . i would need to know what kind of tool thei us .
2579	1	on addit piec of inform need is how much vinegar is need to pour in each of the contain s . there is no amount specifi and that inform is need anoth piec of inform need is how much distil water is us to rins each sampl that amount need to be state last inform determin how to pour the sampl is need becaus that method not to be control so as not to creat water variabl .
2580	1	i would need to know the determin mass of each sampl . so i could complet the investig of the and did fain project . i ll need to pour vinegar in each of four separ contain . then place a sampl of each materi into on contain . then after hour remov the sampl from the contain and rins each sampl with distil water .
2581	1	after read them group s procedur i would add some addit inform to it . first the group should us water as a control to compar with the result of vinegar . second the amount of vinegar ad for each sampl should be identifi and held constantli for each sampl . final the group should also identifi the concentr of the vinegar solut . the amount of vinegar and concentr of the vinegar both affect the accuraci of the data
2582	1	you need to know how much vinegar to us . you also need to know what type of vinegar to us becaus there ar mani differ type . you also need to know the control becaus we need to know what thi is be compar to .
2583	1	the addit inform you need to replic the experi would be the amount of vinegar be pour into the ident contain the amount of each sampl need how much you would remov each sampl from the contain the amount of distil water need and where would you place the sampl to dry . the procedur should be more specif into their step .
2584	1	after read group procedur the addit inform i would need to complet the experi is the the moon of vinegar pour in to each cup also to inde what each sampl i need is in case set not have the data tabl below and final what type of contain should the sampl be place into to avoid a chemic reaction .
2585	1	in order to replic the experi you would need the amount of vinegar us without the exact p in order to replic the experi you would need the amount of vinegar us without the exact amount of vinegar even with the mass of the sampl there is no wai to know if you ar do the correct experi . the amount of vinegar determin how much the mass of the sampl would chang . so without the amount of vinegar there is no wai to replic the experi exactli .
2586	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar is us on each sampl . also more than on trial of the experi should be perform in order to get more accur result . anoth thing need would be on of each sampl without vinegar to act as a control for the experi .
2587	1	after read the step procedur i still need to know to find the differ in mass make a graph and to record my data in order to reproduc their experi .
2588	1	you would need more sampl of materi vinegar and conduct the experi .
2589	1	after read the group procedur i believ that i would need some addit inform in order to replic the experi for instanc the procedur doesn t mention the four sampl be us in the experi thei ar onli pint mention in the student data tabl . also the procedur doesn t tell you how much vinegar need to be ad in the four ident contain . the procedur doesn t mention how much of each sampl need to be place in the contain . and lastli the procedur doesn t tell me what i should measur the mass of the sampl with and how i am suppos to get the differ in mass of the four sampl in the experi .
2590	1	in order to repeat thi procedur accur i would need to know how thei measur the sampl is gram i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how each cup should be label .
2591	1	in the problem it sai wa could by add and i sai safeti experi and a measur to wai the mass .
2592	1	some addit inform i would need in order to replic the experi would be how much vinegar i should pour into each contain . also it should tell us in the procedur that it is requir to find the start mass of the sampl . last where should i put the sampl when i remov then from the contain .
2593	1	in order to replic thi experi from the procedur there is more piec of inform i need to know . what ar the sampl i am put in the contain . how much vinegar am i us . how much of the sampl am i put in the vinegar doe the size and surfac area have to be the same .
2594	1	the addit inform need in order to replic the experi is how much of vinegar to pour in the separ contain . also at what temperatur should the sampl sit at . i need to know if it wa warm or cold dure the hour to see if it affect the harden process of sampl . lastli how hot or cold doe the water have to be to rins off the sampl .
2595	1	the three thing you need in the procedur ar in i you need to know what to weigh it in gram our pound . the second miss piec of inform is how much vinegar to pour in each ident contain . the last piec of inform miss when you rins the substanc how long to rins them for .
2596	1	thi experi lack some kei inform . first of all at no point doe it specifi the strength at the vinegar which could have an effect on how much degrad . correspondingli the surfac area of each object is certainli relat to it degrad . the smaller the surfac area in relat to it mass the less rel degrad . also the environment factor certainli plai a rate to the desper .
2597	1	the first thing i would add in the procedur is what kind of contain . then a control for the experi the final i would add more trial .
2598	1	to replic the experi you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain and how big the sampl should be in size . also you would need to know what kind of wood or plastic you ar test .
2599	1	the addit inform i would put in the procedur is the amount of vinegar you put in the contain . p there also should be a contain with no materi in it just as a refer for the graph . am also when thei put it into a singl contain thei didn t specifi if thei were sit in the contain in the time thei were place for minut .
2600	1	if given onli the inform in the procedur i would still need to know what materi the four sampl should be if the kind of vinegar matter and ani addit necessari materi to do the experi .
2601	1	to replic thi experi much more inform would be need . the first thing thei would need to add is the type of rat and their start mass which need to be held constant . the rd thing is the amount of vinegar us and the rd is the size of the cup . all thi inform is vital in re crate thi experi .
2602	1	in order to replic the group experi i would need to know what kind of contain to us . if the contain should be seal what temperatur should the sampl remain at dure the hour period and for the procedur to be more specif in gener .
2603	1	to replic thi experi you would need to add more sampl to experi with you would also need addit contain to place the sampl in and you would need more vinegar to pour in the contain . if you were to replic thi experi the materi need would have to be ad to determin the mass of the sampl . for replic the experi you mai also add differ materi to determin the differ of the mass .
2604	1	the inform that is need to complet the experi is to tell what kind of rock sampl ar thei us . also there need to be a constant amount of vinegar in each contain . thei didn t sai had much vinegar to us . after hour there wa no specif on how long to rins the sampl .
2605	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need vinegar into four separ but ident contain . you would place a sampl of on materi into on contain and label repeat with remain sampl after hour remov the sampl from the contain and rins each sampl with distil water . let it sit and dry for minut . for addit inform we would need to know why the group of student would come to find the mass of the differ sampl .
2606	1	i would includ the amount of vinegar put into each contain becaus that could have an effect on the overal outcom . i would also includ the name of the sampl becaus how would you know what to place into the contain . after that i would sai how much of each sampl i would put in the contain becaus the amount could chang the outcom .
2607	1	some addit inform that you would need in order to replic thi experi would be how much vinegar would be pour in each contain what the size of each sampl would be and how mani trial should be perform for each materi .
2608	1	to complet anna replic the student s experiment procedur i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in contain . if i do not there will be differ amount which will chang the result . i would also need to know how long to rins each sampl for in how much distil water . final i would need to know how to determin the mass of each sampl .
2609	1	i would need to know how much vinegar to poor into each contain . also how long to rins it . also how big the sampl would need to be .
2610	1	in order to replic thi experi . i would need to know what the sampl ar how much vinegar to pour in the contain and what kind of contain to put the sampl in .
2611	1	in order to be abl to replic thi lab i would need to know the exact amount of vinegar . i would also need to know what temperatur the distil water should be as well as how mani trial thei did pullei trial give more accur answer .
2612	1	i would need to know what four differ sampl to us in step . also i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup in step and also how much of the materi to put in the contain in step .
2613	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know what kind of sampl you will be us . you need to know to us marbl limeston wood and plastic . you also need to know how much vinegar to pour in so that all the sampl have the same exposur and the experi is not taint or flow . the student could also state what kind of contain to us a graduat cylind a beaker or someth els . sai you need a contain is veri vagu .
2614	1	in order for me to complet thi experi i will need to know what the sampl ar . i am go to need to know what we ar quit with . i will also need to have a control variabl .
2615	1	marbl . p limeston . p wood . p plastic .
2616	1	in order to replic thi experi you need to have a control variabl you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup . you also need to know how much water you us to rins with .
2617	1	to replic the experi you would need to know what each of the four materi were in the procedur . you would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain and how long the materi should be rins for after hour .
2618	1	ani addit inform i would need in order to replic the experi of acid rain would be the reliabl of what thi procedur would of been affect on by the independ variabl . i know that the independ variabl is the sampl the depend variabl is the mass chang so how wa the temperatur dure thi experi
2619	1	. how would i determin the mass of each sampl . p .
2620	1	get the mass of four differ sampl and pour the vinegar in each . after hour you remov sampl and rins with water . let dry for minut and then determin mass again .
2621	1	to replic thi experi you would need some addit inform . first you would need to know the amount of vinegar in the cup . you must also know how long to rins the sampl in distil water . anoth faster you must know is the ph level of the vinegar
2622	1	to replic thi experi i would need to know the amount of vinegar us in each contain . if i don t know the amount of vinegar then i won t keep the experi constant with ani result . i would also need to to know the whole procedur includ the safeti tip .
2623	1	in order to replic thi experi the addit inform need would be to give specif ailment of vinegar to put in each contain .
2624	1	to replic the experi the group should includ measur for how much vinegar should be us . thi will give the person replic the experi a greater understand of what to us .
2625	1	in order to replic thi experi i will first need all of the lab materi us i will also need a balanc to record the show mass and find mass . final i will need a calcul to find the differ of the mass . thi experi wa the observ and math that i think with their three piec i would replic to the experi .
2626	1	i would need to know what sampl to us . how should i measur the sampl
2627	1	in order to replic the miss data then the student would need to tell us how much vinegar thei us in the cup . also thei need to tell us how much water thei us . and lastli thei need to tell us what environ to let the sampl dry in . thi is what i need to be abl to repeat the experi .
2628	1	first thei need to sai what materi thei need to do the experi limeston marbl . . . . . . . . also the procedur need to be clearer and thei need to explain the remov process a littl more . also thei do not tell you how much vinegar you need to pour in .
2629	1	other inform would be what measur in the cup how much distil water do you rins with and how to determin the sampl .
2630	1	in order to replic the group s experi there would be sever piec of inform p you would need to know . first you would need to know which devic you would need to us to measur the mass of the sampl and which sampl you would need to us . also you would need to know how much vinegar wa need to be pour into the contain . final you would also need to know how much distil water you should us to rins each sampl for how long you should rins it for and at what temperatur the water should be at .
2631	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know a conclus how long it took for the sampl to dry and how you get the for differ sampl .
2632	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know what kind of vinegar thei us what temperatur the sampl were store at and what size the contain wa .
2633	1	first thing you would do is the control of the procedur . the next thing you would need to know is all of the differ sampl .
2634	1	the addit inform need in order to replic the experi would be the amount of vinegar need in each of the contain . also you would need to know how much distil water to us . the procedur also doe not sai whether or not the sampl such as marbl limeston wood and plastic should all be the same mass .
2635	1	to make a replica of thi experi i would need to know which kind of sampl ar need and then how much of each sampl is need to be place in each contain . then i would also need to know how much vinegar would be need to pour into each contain when remov the sampl to sit and dry while is thi suppos to hop on a tabl under a light etc . that inform would need to be includ for thi experi to be carpet .
2636	1	the addit inform that you ll need in order to replic the experi is that you ll need the procedur in order to figur out th start mass end mass and the differ in mass . for each sampl their start end and differ in mass ar all differ .
2637	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need a scale to measur the four differ sampl a given amount of vinegar to pour in each contain label for each contain and an amount of time to rins each sampl with the distil water .
2638	1	addit inform need would be the exact amount of vinegar whose the sampl ar place to dry and how long to rins each sampl .
2639	1	the addit inform i would need to replic thi lab would be p . the amount of vinegar us . p . the vessel us to hold the sampl becaus it might burn a normal cup . p . how to dry them becaus thei might have us a differ method than i might emploi . p . materi list to know how much of everyth rock vinegar .
2640	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know the amount of vinegar to us also you would need to know the what type of materi to us in the experi and you would need to know how to determin the mass of the sampl .
2641	1	on piec of addit inform on would need to know is how ar you suppos to determin the mass . there ar mani differ wai to determin thi . anoth piec of inform unknown to the cover is how much vinegar on is suppos to us in the experi . final you would need to know what size the sampl need to be .
2642	1	the student procedur wa veri vagu . the first thing thei should it done wa in list all the materi that were requir for the experi . also thei sai to determin the mass of each sampl but thei must includ how to get the mass so it is accur and time the experi is perform . the procedur is also veri vagu when it talk about dure a sampl of on materi into a contain . i do not know list that materi s .
2643	1	start in number thei didn t tell me how much vinegar to pour into a contain thei didn t tell me what type of contain either . thei also didn t tell me what unit of measur to weigh the rock either .
2644	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need specif amount measur and label of the materi involv . i would need to know the specif amount of vinegar pour into each contain . i would need on materi which would result as my control and i would probabl need to know what the mass of each identifi materi wa befor i rins it with distil water .
2645	1	the addit inform need is the name of each of the four sampl how you should weigh the sampl and how much vinegar should be put into the contain .
2646	1	addit inform need in order to replic the experi is how much vinegar is to be pour into the contain what thing of sampl ar need how to label the contain that the sampl and vinegar in it and what kind of thing ar need for the control .
2647	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each contain . thei also never tell you what you need sampl of to us dure the experi . lastli it is never mention to record your data or what materi ar us thought the experi .
2648	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar is need . i would also need to know what to us to weigh the mass of each item .
2649	1	the addit inform that i would need in order to complet thi experi would be how much vinegar wa pour into each of the four contain . also you would need to give the direct to determin what us the four differ sampl were for each of the cup . lastli you would need to accur determin which wa the control in the experi and to tell the differ in two mass .
2650	1	in thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar to add . if you place it in sun or shade and . and where you need the contain as .
2651	1	the group forgot to includ how much vinegar to pour into the cup . thei also did not sai what to label the cup after you ar finish .
2652	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know why you need to know the mass of four differ sampl . what ar you try to do with that inform . also you would need to know how much vinegar you need to pour into the sampl you also need to know if the water you need to rins the sampl with should be cold or hot .
2653	1	thei did not give you a by inform sign in what temperatur we should keep the it in thei also didn t tell you how much vinegar to pour in . anoth kei inform thei didn t give us is what is the sampl .
2654	1	you would need the amount of vinegar pour into the contain to make sure it wa equal . you d also need a suppli list so you know a need of time what you need . anoth thing you d need to know wa where to keep the sampl ie room temperatur in the dark etc
2655	1	the addit inform i would add would be the amount of vinegar need . how big of a piec of sampl to us and how big of a clip that is need .
2656	1	in the third step of the procedur it doe not clarifi what materi you ar put into the contain also it doe not explain what you ar suppos to label the contain and why . it just sai label it also doesn t sai what type of contain to us and how much vinegar should be pour .
2657	1	how to determin the mass .
2658	1	after read the procedur i would need three addit piec of inform to replic thi experi . i would need to know the amount of vinegar ad to each contain what kind of contain to us and the type of sampl to us .
2659	1	the procedur would need to identifi the sampl and how much vinegar have .
2660	1	three addit piec of inform you would need in order to replic thi experi ar whet to weigh the mass ha how much vinegar to put in the cup and how big the a sampl is .
2661	1	thi addit inform you would need to replic thi experi is how much vinegar you pour into each contain anoth addit inform you would need is the same measur scale that you weigh each sampl an you also should know what kin d of contain to us and about how much of each sampl to test .
2662	1	the inform i would add to thi procedur is what the sampl ar . although the data tabl show them . if we didn t have the tabl we wouldn t know what we re test . i would add abl limeston wood and plastic instead of just repeat sampl .
2663	1	in order to replic thi experi the student should . specifi the amount of vinegar to be ad to the sampl . . each sampl should have the same start mass and . specifi what kind of condit to let them sit the hour in .
2664	1	thei didn t includ how much vinegar thei pour in each sampl cup . how would thei measur the mass
2665	1	for thi experi the student should state what kind of materi in the procedur befor collect the data and put of on a tabl . also get more of the same materi so you can test them on differ time . and also the student should lengthen their time on the experi .
2666	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know the size of the sampl . the surfac area vari depend on the size . in order to replic thi experi i need to have the same surfac area . i would need to know the amount of vinegar pour over the rock . if the then the replic experi would not be the same . i would also need to know about the environ the contain ar kept at such as the temperatur and whether or not light is expos to the contain .
2667	1	the addit inform i would need to replic thi procedur is what the sampl ar what to us to weigh each sampl and what to label the sampl as on the contain .
2668	1	you will need all the met earl to replic thi experi like the sampl marbl limeston wood and plastic . and a scale to determin the mass befor and after your experi . and allow all the sampl to sit and dry for the full minut . then weight all the sampl accord to the mass .
2669	1	you would still need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain how much water you should us to rins the sampl for . you also need to know if you ar work just at the procedur what sampl you would need to acquir .
2670	1	the procedur didn t state how much vinegar wa need to pour into each contain . it also doesn t sai what to label the contain . the procedur also doe not sai how long to rins the sampl . all of these can chang the data of the experi if thei ar not all the same state in the procedur .
2671	1	in order to replic the experi i would need to know the ph the vinegar becaus the ph of y differ vinegar mai vari . and i would need to know the approxim shape of the sampl becaus if the limeston for exampl ha a greater surfac area then it would corrod faster becaus more of it surfac is touch the vinegar . also i would want to know if the vinegar cover the sampl complet in all three contain or not becaus if a stone is onli half cover by vinegar it doe not horror as fast as a stone cover complet by vinegar .
2672	1	thi is a good procedur becaus thei ar keep track of their process that thei get . at the start mass marbl . end . differ in mass . . start mass limeston . end mass . differ in mass . . all thei ar do is keep track of the process thei get .
2673	1	an addit piec of inform would be how much vinegar to pour into the sampl contain . it would be help the scientist to know which unit to measur the mass in kg g mg and in step y . the time need to rins the sampl would be need becaus the rins time could affect the result .
2674	1	to replic thi group experi you would need to know how much vinegar you should pour into each contain . you would also need to know what type of contain to us befor that and after the experi . you would also need to know what size the sampl should be .
2675	1	after i read the produc i came upon the conclus of get anoth sampl natur to replic thi experi .
2676	1	i would need to know what the contain were made of . what wa the ph of the vinegar wa and how mani trial to each sampl were perform .
2677	1	on thing you would need to know is what ar the four differ sampl that we should us . anoth you need to know to replic thi experi is how much vinegar to pour in each contain . the last piec of inform you might need to know is how to find the mass . in step of the procedur thei should have mention us a tripl beam balanc scale or the type of scale thei us . without your experi could be veri differ from their .
2678	1	after read the group s procedur some addit inform thei would need to put in in order to replic the experi is firstli what sort of contain do you put the substanc in to . secondli instead of sai place a singl sampl thei should tell us a specif amount to put in each contain . next in step be more specif about the direct concern the vinegar and lastli thei should tell us what the differ sampl ar of cours .
2679	1	on piec of inform that i would need in order to replic the experi would be the amount of vinegar volum in each contain . anoth piec of inform i would need would be the temperatur of the vinegar . for exampl if the vinegar wa warm it could caus the materi to decreas in mass more rapidli . lastli i would need to know the size of the four differ contain . it would also help to know what materi those contain were made out of .
2680	1	to replic the experi addit inform that would be need is to determin the mass in gram the type of sampl and the type of contain would all have to be ident .
2681	1	on of the inform need at the begin of the procedur is what ar the four differ materi we ar deal with . thei also should have told if it wa at room temperatur . thei did not sai in the procedur if the contain should be left in clear airi space or if it should be in a dark place .
2682	1	the addit inform i would need in order to replic the experi is to know how much vinegar to pour in each contain what the sampl ar that i m test and what do i weigh the stone on to get their mass .
2683	1	it would need to sai in the procedur to have the start mass . it would need to sai what these sampl ar . the procedur would also have to includ that the student have to find the differ in the mass .
2684	1	the three piec of inform i would need to know in order to replic the experi ar as follow the amount of each sampl ex . how much marbl the amount of vinegar to immers the sampl and vinegar should be kept in ex room temperatur
2685	1	i think the inform you would need to replic experi is the start fact .
2686	1	after read thi group procedur thei need to tell me what kind of sampl stone . thei also need to tell me to take the mass of the sampl befor place it with the vinegar . lastli if the group told me to do more than on trial the inform would be more valid .
2687	1	if you were go to replic it you would do the exact same step but i would probabl us four other sampl and us someth els instead of vinegar and i would probabl have it be hour not .
2688	1	first i would need to know how much vinegar wa in each contain then i would need to know the size of the contain . i would also have to know what kind of sampl thei us .
2689	1	the addit inform that i would add is which on ha the most mass and which on ha the least mass and have a conclus to the experi .
2690	1	you would also have to includ the type of sampl what the temperatur should be what do you do with the sampl after the minut and how mani trial thi experi should includ .
2691	1	. how much vinegar do you need to pour in . p . how larg of a contain is it . p . how long can you rins the sampl of water for .
2692	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know what kind of contain the materi we put into . also what wa the labor temperatur at which the sampl wa done .
2693	1	after read the group procedur four piec of addit inform that must be ad to replic the experi ar the name of the four sampl the size of the contain the amount of vinegar us for each sampl and there must be a control .
2694	1	in order to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar to put into each contain also what kind of vinegar to put into the contain .
2695	1	first i would need to know how much vinegar to put into each contain . also we would need to know what materi the contain should be made of becaus if we us plastic contain the substanc could be affect the same wai the sampl materi ar . lastli the procedur written by the student doe not tell us what to us to remov the sampl from the contain nor doe it place an amount of distil water to us when rins the sampl .
2696	1	i believ that i would need the control variabl independ variabl and the depend variabl . becaus if you don t have these three thing their investig not go to come at how thei expect it . that the three thing most import when you do an experi or investig .
2697	1	you would need to know how big the contain ar . if you need to dry it in a cool or dry area and how much vinegar you need to put in each contain
2698	1	some addit inform that is need to replic the experi is you could leav the sampl in for longer period of time . you could allow the sampl to dry for longer period of time becaus some of the sampl take longer to dry than other . such as what it is harder to dry than marbl you can also try put each sampl in the same contain and see what would happen .
2699	1	there need to be a part that sai how much vinegar is to be put in each contain . how much of a sampl to put in the vinegar and the experi should sai what the sampl be test ar .
2700	1	if had to make a replic of thi experi some addit inform would had been . how much vinegar to add in each contain and how much mass everi sampl thei all would read the same amount .
2701	1	on addit inform would be to know what the four differ sampl were . anoth wai for the inform to be clear would be to tell how you go to measur the mass . lastli it shouldnt be contain you should know much of the differ sampl ar in the contain . if it like a graduat cylind or someth differ .
2702	1	if i were to duplic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar to put into each cup . without know how much vinegar to put into the cup the out come would turn out veri differ .
2703	1	what could have been done is the should have told me how much vinegar thei put becaus what if thei fill the glass on and i onli put tablespoon the result will not be the same . and the third step is not clean shouldn t there be an experi involv like water becaus mai be when sampl have into content with a liquid that ha chang .
2704	1	what i think should be addit to thi procedur is see how thei came out and look . p the th part of the procedur see how the start mass came out the end mass and the differ in mass . p also find out the averag of each sampl .
2705	1	you would need to get the materi the sampl of moral limeston wood and plastic vinegar and contain and step record your result and also make a hypothesi befor you start do ani thing .
2706	1	addit inform that can be ad is a control to see if ani thing will happen to a certain rock without rins it or put it in the acid rain in for a differ time . also you can us at least on other sampl of stone . the procedur can also includ to have the person write a hypothesi or a safeti guid .
2707	1	we must know how much vinegar is be put into contain to keep it consist . we must make the surfac area of the sampl equal . we must make sure the contain ar the same materi .
2708	1	the composit in of the sampl amount of each sampl amount of vinegar to be pour .
2709	1	the procedur is miss a vital step . thei need to write out how much vinegar thei us for each sampl . the amount should be the same us for all sampl .
2710	1	first you would need to know the quantiti of vinegar need . that measur is not given and is essenti to the experi . furthermor the type of contain is not given for instanc should the vinegar be pour into a flask or beaker final it doe not sai where to leav the contain for the hour . there could be a larg differ in the out come if the contain ar left in a warm environ instead of a cold on .
2711	1	in order to replic thi experi you must pour vinegar in each of the four ident contain . other trial so you can see if you get the same result for each sampl . then you can averag if you get differ result . have a control group and just ran distil water with vinegar so you can compar the result with vinegar so you can compar the result with sampl that have vinegar with them .
2712	1	thei did not tell at what temperatur the rock were in . thei did not tell us how much vinegar wa in each of the contain . thei did not tell how long to leav the rock in the vinegar .
2713	1	in order to replic the experi we would need to know what materi to us the procedur sai place a sampl of on materi . but it never specifi what kind of materi to us .
2714	1	i think you also need to know how much time it took for each sampl to pervers in mass .
2715	1	to be abl to replic thi procedur you would need to includ what type of sampl you need how much vinegar to us in each sampl you would also need to includ what type of contain you should us .
2716	1	the thing you would need is what to us for your four sampl . thei should also sai what to us as contain . the procedur should also tell you what to label them and if there is a control .
2717	1	the student also should shake how much vinegar to us and where it leas the contain such as on a window on in the floor .
2718	1	the group would need to includ the differ type of sampl that thei want you to weigh . you also need the amount of vinegar to put into the contain the unit of weigh need to be includ also to determin the mass befor after the vinegar .
2719	1	in order to replic thi experi in a more effect wai you would need to state the materi you ar test in the procedur establish as exact orient of vinegar and chair the size of each contain .
2720	1	after read the group procedur describ what addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi . make sure to includ list three piec of inform . i believ thei add the time differ and that s it .
2721	1	addit inform i would need in order to replic thi experi would be how much vinegar should i us what size should the contain i us be what sampl should be us .
2722	1	the group should includ find the differ in mass in the procedur sinc it s part of the data tabl . thei also should ve weigh the sampl befor thei let it dry becaus weight could ve been affect by the dry process .
2723	1	the addit inform you would need for thi is how much of the materi you would need . the measur and what exactli you ar try to figur out in the experi . to replic thi experi you would need vinegar in four separ contain . the sampl that you ar go to place insid . marbl limeston wood plastic .
2724	1	the student should have ad in number what king of sampl thei were weigh . thei should have also ad how much vinegar to put in the separ contain . in between number and number the student should have ad to record the mass on data tabl and after number thei should have done the same thing too .
2725	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar to pour how much of each sampl to pour what ar the four differ sampl where would i place the remov sampl and the specif materi i would need .
2726	1	to replic thi work you would need to know what four sampl thei us in thi case marbl limeston wood and plastic . you also need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain . also you have to weigh the sampl befor put them in the vinegar you would need to know thee three thing befor you could replic the experi .
2727	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to have more contain present . then you would need more materi to put into the contain . now lastli you would have to have the experi go on for anoth hour in order to see if your result come out differ .
2728	1	the addit inform is that we need to do in order and put veri tearfulli becaus the contain can broke and the them other hour we need to do all process veri care becaus someth can go bad
2729	1	the first thing you would need to know in order to replic the experi would be what the four differ sampl ar . anoth would be a list what materi you would need also what kind of contain to put them in and last where to keep them over the hour .
2730	1	. measur the same amount of differ sampl that ar marbl limeston wood and plastic p . in four differ but ident contain put the same amount of vinegar . p . place a sampl of on materi in each contain and label them . p . repeat step number for each sampl . p . leav the sampl in a dry place for hour . p . after the hour let the sampl dry for about min and then measur them .
2731	1	how much vinegar i need to put in the contain and what kind of contain and how much stone must be us .
2732	1	in order to replic thi experi you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain how long to rins each sampl with distil water and what the four mass ar .
2733	1	the addit inform that is need to replic thi experi is to tell what the four sampl ar in the statement . if we don t know what the sampl ar we can t do thi experi . thei should ve also includ how much vinegar to us becaus it can affect the experi .
2734	1	i would just replic the procedur in order to replic the student work .
2735	1	addit inform that would be need to repeat thi group procedur would be the four differ sampl materi what the mass of the materi would be and how much vinegar to add to each contain .
2736	1	limeston . . . . p marbl . . . . . p plastic . . p wood . p i think the wood is the smallest becaus the differ in mass e wa onli .
2737	1	in order to replic thi experi by read the procedur you will need to know how much vinegar is in each contain what sampl the group us and how much distil water wa us to rins off the sampl .
2738	1	the other addit inform that i that it need to be ad is the amount of vinegar that wa ad to each sampl . also if thei ad water to the vinegar were the sampl wa .
2739	1	you would need what four sampl thei were test the amount of vinegar need and what temperatur the contain need tone kept in order to replic thi experi .
2740	1	the inform on in thi procedur is not clearli state . to replic the experi the group need to repeat what thei did the group also didn t list the four thing be test in the procedur . the student did not state what wa in control .
2741	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know how much vinegar thei pour
2742	1	some addit inform that can be ad is of measur time interv . you could leav each of the materi in the contain longer than hour like . you can see a larger differ in mass then . anoth thing you could do is choos differ materi other than the on shown . on other thing you could chang is the amount of time the sampl sit and dry for as well as perhap us a differ liquid other than vinegar . thi wai you could determin if by us a differ liquid a differ in mass would be shown .
2743	1	after read the group s procedur i would need at least three piec of inform in order to replic that experi . i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contain what sampl to us i . e what sampl thei us onli look at the procedur and not the data size of the contain thei us . i would also have a control us just water and more trial . p answer question how it read becaus it ask after read the procedur and not after read the data tabl .
2744	1	in the procedur thei need to determin what the sampl ar also thei need to tell you ax erectli how much vinegar and rock to put in . if there is to rock the vinegar won t break it down . it should sai in the procedur either to us gram or kg .
2745	1	some addit inform that you need in order to replic thi experi is how much vinegar you pour in each cup becaus if the disdain amount relic cum ar inaccur . also how much water or how long do you need to rins each object . also for the experi you need to us the same type of vinegar the size of each cup and the exact minut shown .
2746	1	to replic thi experi thei need to tell us the control . and list all the thing that need to be kept constant like amount of vinegar type of vinegar the size of the cup .
2747	1	you would need to includ what you measur the mass with . what kind of state were us and the last were of inform what kind of vinegar wa us when do the experi .
2748	1	addit inform that you would need to know if you want to replic thi expir mint is how much vinegar to pour into the sampl how long you should rins each sampl with distil water and what ar these differ sampl also .
2749	1	you would also need to know how much of each sampl thei us how much vinegar thei us how much distil water thei us and how much light wa us on them to dry in order to replic the experi .
2750	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know what it is the group is look for why thei were do the experi the amount of vinegar that is to be pour onto the substanc what kind of contain to us and weather or not the sampl need to be caper while sit in vinegar or not .
2751	1	to replic the student experi i would need to know how much vinegar to us what size contain to put the sampl in and where i should do the experi . each of these would drastic chang the outcom of the experi . for exampl if there wa more vinegar in on contain that sampl would have more nod .
2752	1	addit inform need to replic the experi would be the type of materi us . thei ar not state in the procedur . it would also be ideal to have the amount of concentr of vinegar in each contain . the locat of the contain is also import . the effect that the vinegar ha mai be differ in differ temperatur . the procedur should also determin to what decim place the mass should be taken .
2753	1	the addit inform that thei would need is how big wa the contain becaus it said that thei pour vinegar into the contain and left . hover night thei also need it to add on where did thei all it over night becaus wa left somewher for hour . how did thei determin the mass in the first place becaus thei never said that thei us anyth to determin the mass in the begin and end .
2754	1	to replic the experi you would need to indic the amount of vinegar need what temperatur is need and what safeti requir is necessari . also what the purpos of the experi is .
2755	1	we have to know all about how the mass chang in marbl the start mass is the . but end mass is . the differ in mass . we need to know how that happen how the mass chang how mach time the mass take for chang but limeston start mass . end mass . differ . the question is how that happen why becaus the visag go into the nuclei of the morsel or affect at moss of the morsel limeston wood plastic the .
2756	1	in order to repeat thi experi it is necessari to know how much vinegar is put into each contain . also the size and the shape of the contain is need . addit it is import to know the exact ph of the vinegar be us . final it is import to know the size and shape of each materi sampl . each of these would greatli affect the result .
2757	1	addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi you need to know how much vinegar should be place into the four ident contain you need to make sure you remov the sampl materi from each contain at the same time and how much distil water should be us to rise each sampl .
2758	1	in order to replic the experi on must first be more specif with the explain in their experi . thei should list the tool thei us for each variabl . also the student should be more clear with their step . thei need to more accur with all of their data .
2759	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar to add to the contain you would also need to know how the differ sampl ar that you ar measur the last peac of inform need is what materi ar be us in the contain .
2760	1	the addit inform that would be need to replic thi experi what the four sampl ar wear safeti protect and keep a data chart of the start and end mass and differ in mass .
2761	1	you need to know the specif amount of the sampl you have in order to duplic the experi and the condit that thei perform the experi . exampl temp is the room and of air pressur . you also need to know the materi includ in thi experi .
2762	1	well first of all it doesn t tell you how much vinegar to put into each . cup you also need to know what materi we will need for the experi . as well as how much water to us so it deposit effect weight .
2763	1	addit inform i would need in order to replic the experi would be have my sampl as marbl limeston wood plastic all label so i would now which wa ad the amount of vinegar . anoth addit inform would be test each on twice list to be sure and reliabl enough for each sampl .
2764	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know what the control is . also i would want to know if all the sampl should have the same start mass . lastli i would want to know how mani trial to do .
2765	1	to replic the experi you would have to find new sampl to put in the vinegar you would also have to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar into the cup but to chang it littl you could us a differ kind of cup .
2766	1	after read the procedur
2767	1	to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each contain how long to rins each sampl with distil water and how i wa to determin the mass of each sampl .
2768	1	you would need a hypothesi
2769	1	thei didn t specifi the amount of vinegar thei put in each cup . thei didn t sai what temperatur thei kept each cup at . thei didn t sai how much of each sampl thei put in the cup either .
2770	1	in order to replic the experi i would need some constant what stai the same and a control . i would also need to know how to determin the mass of each sampl and i would need o know where to put the sampl in a cold or warm environ in the sunlight or dark
2771	1	in the procedur you would need to includ what four type of sampl and their weight . also you will need to know how much vinegar to add into the contain and what type of a contain those ar includ for thi experi .
2772	1	to replic the experi you would need to know what tool thei us . also what the temperatur wa . final thei need to tell you how much vinegar to us .
2773	1	to replic thi experi i would need to know what amount of materi wa us in the vinegar how much vinegar wa us and at what temperatur thi sampl were store at .
2774	1	in the first step describ how to find the mass same with the last step .
2775	1	in the procedur it state place a materi into on contain and label should have list the materi be us and write what happen over on dai while the experi wa in affect .
2776	1	i order to replic thi experi you would need anoth set of materi .
2777	1	i can t know
2778	1	in thi experi you need to know how much vinegar you need to us .
2779	1	the student s data record on the tabl is not enough to properli replic the experi . the tabl show onli the mass of the differ materi but it should show other import piec of data as well . the tabl should includ how much vinegar wa put into the contain what type of contain is be us how long the sampl sat in the vinegar and how long thei were set to dry .
2780	1	in order to replic the experi there is a list of addit inform need in the group procedur to start we would need to know to determin the mass so a sampl in the procedur it should sing to art a tripl bean bean balanc and describ step for calcul the mass . also in order to complet it experi would need to know the far differ sampl bring us . next the procedur should includ how much vinegar and the amount of each sampl should be pour on contain . final it would be help if we keep when and a contain and sting us in the experi and where should would place that experi to allow them to dry prioriti .
2781	1	in order to be abl to amper thi experi you need to know how much vinegar you need to put into the contain a second piec of inform you need to know to what type of contain to us i . e glass or plastic a third piec of inform measur for thi experi is how kg each sampl should be .
2782	1	thi procedur is veri vagu . first of all all thei sai is four differ sampl and then thei don t even sai what the sampl ar or what of . also thei didn t sai how much vinegar to put in . in order to replic the experi i need thi inform .
2783	1	the three piec of inform left out of these experi instruct ar as follow first what materi the sampl ar second how much vinegar should be pour into each contain and third in what wai should the sampl be remov .
2784	1	the addit inform need to replic thi experi is how much vinegar do we need to us how much of each materi and what ar the materi . without know how much vinegar it couldn t be accur becaus not everi contain would have the same amount same with the materi . and the group doesn t list the materi in the procedur what kind of tool we need to know .
2785	1	i would need the time when thi experi wa prefer and when it wa done . also
2786	1	on piec of inform need to replic thi take is the amount of vinegar ad to each contain . anoth piec of inform necessari is how much distil water to rins the sampl with . final you need to know where the sampl should sit to dry . without these piec of inform you cannot react the procedur .
2787	1	the main piec inform is what type of vinegar and how each of it . how much water should each sampl to be rins with . also it wa never mention what the sampl should be . in the instanc you can tell that on need marbl limeston wood and plastic by look on the data tabl .
4492	2	thei could of improv to remov the weight and clamp and measur the length of the plastic type .
4493	2	in conclus the student found that the plastic type did stretch out consider . plastic stretch the most increas in length mm while plastic a stretch the least with mm . i think that the student should have includ the origin length of the plastic in data tabl includ the origin length of the plastic in the data tabl . thi would give a better idea of what the test piec look like and would help reader understand the experi more anoth thing the student could have done wa do more trial . in both trial conduct the amount the plastic stretch had chang so more trial make it clearer .
4494	2	a . base on the student s data plastic type b wa the stretchiest becaus it stretch the most amount . p b . ar why to improv the experi would be to make all the plastic the same length so thei can be compar easier . anoth improv would be to add the same amount of weight to each plastic . if thei were differ it would affect how much the plastic stretch .
4495	2	a plastic type a t increas by t plastic type b t decreas by t . plastic type c t decreas by t plastic type d t stai neutral as t . p b the student could ve improv their result if thei let the clamp with weight on it to hang more than minut .
4496	2	a base on the data plastic type b ha the most stretchabl . t mm t mm . plastic a onli stretch t mm t mm . plastic t mm t mm . plastic d t m t mm . plastic b stretch the most each trial and even attach mm more from the t to t . b the student could have improv the experiment design by sai how mani weight will clamp on to each plastic and what you measur the length with .
4497	2	a in conclus it wa plastic type b that stretch most reach an averag length of . mm . plastic type a howev didn t fare as well and stretch to an averag length of mm . plastic d manag to stretch to mm and plastic type c wa elong to about . mm . p b two wai the student could have improv the the conclus of the experi and the valid of the result would have been by dictat a specif length that each polym should begin as and add a column to the data tabl sai what the chang in length wa for each plastic type .
4498	2	in the polym investig the type of plastic that stretch the most is plastic type b with a whole mm and on first trial beat type a c d with the most stretch and in nd trial stretch mm . thi wai the student could have improv the experiment design is that thei could have the plastic befor be stretch .
4499	2	from the data collect dure thi lab it is evid that plastic type b d ar veri similar in strength and ar not too compact . plastic type a c howev ar similar in strength and veri resist to physic forc . thi lab could be improv simpli bye standard rise both the length on the plastic befor test and the weight appli to them .
4500	2	the conclus that ha been veri notic is plastic type b had the most stretchabl . polym plastic with trial t have mm and trial t have mm .
4501	2	plastic d ha the most stretchabl and stai the same for trial on and two . plastic a ha the least . the student could have did at least two or more trial and could of add anoth plastic type .
4502	2	a polym b can stretch th most in trial it stretch mm and in t mm . the least stretchabl wa polym a stretch cm d mm in trial and respect . p b the student could ve improv their experi by first be specif about how much weight should be attach to the polym . next thei should measur the plastic under tension becaus after the tendon is releas it can insert etch
4503	2	my conclus base on thi experi . is that plastic a and b ar the strongest plastic sinc thei endur more than the other two bag . two wai these kid could have improv their experi is that thei could have given extra length to the tape and thei also could ve increas their experi to a trial .
4504	2	a base on my data my conclus would be that b would be the materi that stretch the most . p b student should alwai test experi at least time the procedur should of shown more detail like the weight amount thei us or even what type of plastic materi thei us .
4505	2	a in my conclus when i stretch the plastic with the weight the stretchiest plastic wa type b . the firmest plastic trial stretch the least wa type a . p b the student should have includ a statement problem becaus it wa unclear in the purpos of thi experi . in step the student should make the instruct more clear . for instanc thei could have said someth like repeat step for the remain three plastic .
4506	2	in conclus base upon the student data between trial and there ha becom a pattern for each a b c d . the number go lower to high back to low and back up onc more to high . for exampl trial it goe a b c and d . for trial it goe a b c and d .
4507	2	the conclus base on the student data is that plastic a and b show an increas in the amount stretch between two trial while plastic c and d show no increas in the amount stretch two trial . two wai that the student could have improv the experi is by identifi the type of plastic that he wa test as well as conduct more trial to improv valid .
4508	2	a base off the student data plastic type b wa the on that wa stretch out the most . i can sai thi becaus in the data tabl it sai b t t . p b the student could have done better is measur the plastic while it s hang off the tabl . lastli thei could have done is arrang the time minut is too long thei should ve done minut .
4509	2	a accord to the data t wa more success becaus for plastic type a and b the amount stretch wa more than it wa in t . in t the plastic wa more stretch . p b . the student could have us differ clamp to see if it affect the stretch . p . thei could have extend the time .
4510	2	a in trial two onli plastic type a b stretch more than trial plastic type c d either stai the save of stretch . p b do more trial and test out differ length of plastic
4511	2	base on the student data plastic type b is the stretchiest becaus dure both trial it stretch mm which is more than the other plastic . p the student would have improv the valid and experiment design by ad trial and make clear how much weight wa hung from each of piec of plastic .
4512	2	a it can be conclud that plastic b had the most stretchabl . i sai thi becaus the amount it stretch wa much more than the other plastic . p b thi experi could be improv in a coupl wai first for the second trial the student should be sure to us anoth sampl of that plastic . anoth wai thi could be improv would be to a clamp for the top of the plastic instead of tape .
4513	2	from my result i can conclud that the plastic that wa the most stretchabl wa type b . plastic type b had the greatest length in stretchabl compar to the rest . type d wa veri stretchabl as well measur mm in each trial but plastic b measur mm and mm . on thing i would improv to thi experi is make sure all the plastic in the begin ar the same length . second specifi how mani weight ar ad to the clone .
4514	2	conclus of thi experi would be that plastic type b wa the polym that stretch the most . trial on it stretch mm and trial two it stretch mm . p on wai thei could improv the experi is to record and keep the amount of weight ad to the clamp for more valid result . thei could also perform more than just two trial for a more valid result .
4515	2	a my conclus base on the student at is that from a c the thread goe up and on d thei both ar the same . p b thei could of count how mani weight thei put the time that thei practic the trial to show differ .
4516	2	base on the data provid plastic a and c stretch almost half the amount that plastic b and d did . in conclus plastic a and c ar stronger and better for the us of groceri bag or food protect while plastic b and d ar for when materi need to stretch . the valid of the experiment design is question . the student didn t give an exact weight for amount of weight to stretch on which doesn t give accur data . the student should ve specifi what type of plastic .
4517	2	the student could do the experi mute time and keep the temp futur the same and the time and th ph . p make t differ .
4518	2	a . you can conclud from thi data that plastic type b is the stretchiest . plastic a stretch mm and mm . plastic b stretch mm and mm . plastic c stretch mm and mm plastic d stretch mm and mm . p a wai to improv thi experi would to have a control to hang off the tabl for minut . also you want to make sure the weight be ad to the plastic is a constant weight .
4519	2	. a base on the data plastic type a is the most stretchabl . b the student could have put the first measur in the data tabl also a could have specifi how much weight wa us .
4520	2	a conclus that i can draw on the data is that plastic type b stretch the most ha the most stretchabl and type a ha the least . wai that the student could have improv their experi is cut all the type of plastic the same length so thei could start off the same . anoth thing thei could have improv is list their indec depend variabl . thi is ani conclus about their lab .
4521	2	a base on the student result i d have to sai plastic type b had the overal best stretchabl valu while plastic type a seem not to qualifi so much in thi area . p b the student could have improv thi experi by specifi the weight of each weight and how mani weight to add to the clamp . the result ar valid to extent . to make them more conclus and higher their valid the student could have let the weight hang for differ amount of time for each trial .
4522	2	in the polym lab plastic b is the strongest . plastic type b stretch a total of mm were plastic a onli stretch mm in total . two wai the student could have improv the experi is to have more trial . also make the plastic begin measur the same size .
4523	2	base on the student data plastic type a the amount stretch mm increas from mm . plastic type b amount stretch increas from mm . plastic type c amount stretch stai the same . p the student could have improv the experi by do trial and do a control variabl .
4524	2	my conclus for thi experi is that the polym us for plastic type a made the plastic stretch more than other . thi student could ve label everyth like the name of the plastic polym . anoth thing wa he didn t state the problem or question .
4525	2	i conclud that both trial and trial s result were almost ident . for plastic type a and b trial stretch farthest . in plastic type c trial stretch further . final in plastic type d both trial and stretch mm . p thei should have measur veri plastic type not just . step should be record your data and make a graph .
4526	2	plastic type b stretch the most while type a stretch the least . thi experi doe not need improv . it is fine the wai it is . all experi ar beauti in their own wai .
4527	2	two wai the student could have done better on their experiment design is on thing thei should of instead of take an exampl of on plastic take a sampl from all four plastic . also the weight of clamp bass and had then put longer then give minut .
4528	2	base on the student data i can conclud that plastic type b wa the weakest becaus it stretch the most and becam deform weight . also i can conclud that plastic type a wa the strongest becaus it realli stretch and it held it form . wai the student could have improv thi experi is by tell us what type of plastic it is also make sure all plastic piec ar cut the same thi wai on doesn t have an advantag .
4529	2	plastic type b ha the most stretchabl . on wai the student could have improv their experi is by make sure each type of plastic ha the same length . anoth wai their experi could have been improv is if the student did more trial .
4530	2	the date not accur becaus thei did not said what the length it is there no control and there miss a third trial . p b thei should pick a length for the plastic and have a control .
4531	2	a plastic type b wa veri stretchi becaus it stretch mm when weight were ad to it . on the other hand plastic type a wa the least stretchi becaus it onli stretch mm . b on wai to improv the the experi is to specifi how much weight is be place on the plastic . right now that amount is unclear and mai pose a valid issu . anoth wai to improv the experi is to specifi how long each plastic type is . thei should all be the same length becaus if on is longer there will be more of it hang off the tabl which would make it a bit more stretchi and throw off valid .
4532	2	a accord to the student s data the plastic that stretch the most wa plastic type b . in the first trial it stretch mm . in the second trial it stretch mm . p b the student could ve improv the experiment design by ad more trial . thei also could ve been specif on how mani pound to add on the plastic .
4533	2	plastic type a wa the least stretchi polym and plastic type b wa the most stretchi . the student could have improv the valid of the result by do three trial instead of two and find the averag of all three . also thei should have specifi the amount of weight and that the same amount should be us for each plastic type becaus the result would not be valid if weight wa anoth independ variabl
4534	2	my conclus base on the student data the amount of the plastic type the first wai the student should have improv repeat the procedur exactli for the remain of all plastic the second on perform a second trial exactli like the first on .
4535	2	b two wai the student could have improv thi experi is by ad more group and recit the experi trial p a plastic type a is better than the other becaus dure the trial didn t stretch much as other on so that mean that is better .
4536	2	a the trial and differ in the amount stretch by increas and decreas at time . p b thei should have done trial not and sai repeat step not repeat exactli to do trial number .
4537	2	a plastic b ha the best tensil stretch in compar to plastic a c and d . p b . the student could do more trial and make sure the plastic ar all the same type .
4538	2	the data show that plastic type b is the most durabl plastic out of all of them . some wai he could have improv were to have a rd trial . also instead of us onli time of plastic he could have gotten or more time .
4539	2	. base on the student s data plastic type d stretch the most .
4540	2	from the student s data you can conclud that plastic type b is the stretchiest and plastic type a is the least stretchi . two wai the student could have improv the experi ar to increas the amount of trial and to increas the number of plastic bag test .
4541	2	base on the trial it show that plastic type d stretch more then ani of the other plastic . p two wai thei could have improv there lab would be measur how far off of the tabl each piec should be measur it so it the same and to add the some amount of weight to each plastic .
4542	2	a all of the plastic stretch after minut of weight were hang from it . the largest plastic stretch wa plastic b it stretch mm mm . p b two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and or valid of the result ar sai the amount of weight us for the stretch and have anoth trial .
4543	2	from thi data i can conclud that plastic d stretch the most therefor it held the most weight . when weight wa ad the plastic in the plastic increas and began to stretch . p on wai thi student could have improv the valid of their result is by ad anoth trial to increas reliabl . anoth wai thi student could have improv valid is by ad differ type of plastic increas the type of variabl .
4544	2	base on the student data plastic type b stretch the most plastic d second most plastic c third most and plastic type a stretch the least . i think the student could have improv their valid by hang all the plastic next to each other and put the same amount of weight on all of them at the same time and record how far each stretch befor thei snap .
4545	2	base on the data on which plastic ha the most stretchabl i can conclud that most of the plastic either got a littl bit longer or stai the same in trial after minut . also the c type plastic might have gotten smaller becaus it wa a stronger plastic and didn t want to stretch . two wai the experi could ve been improv wa by instead of us tape thei should ve us someth stronger like mo s clamp . also anoth wai thei could ve chang the balanc of the result would be to let the plastic hang longer than min so thei have more time to stretch .
4546	2	base on the result plastic b had the most stretchabl not of all of the plastic sampl in trial be stretch to mm and in trial be stretch to mm . the student heav specifi exactli how mani weight would be ad to the clamp . the student also should have ad a control to compar to the other plastic for exampl a plastic sampl that could not stretch .
4547	2	a the experi is be test on how the polym plastic be affect on stretchabl . the independ variabl is the plastic type . the depend variabl is the amount of stretch . it s constant by repeat the same trial more than onc . the data show trial is best of amount stretch . the control is trial . p b two wai the student have improv on the experi is to repeat more and same time .
4548	2	a plastic type d is the least stretchabl and plastic type a is the most stretchabl . p b the student should have explain how the weight should be ad it is unclear how or how much weight should be ad . thei should also make all the plastic piec the same length make the data easier to read .
4549	2	from the data you can conclud polym b is capabl of be stretch the most and polym a is the least . improv that could be made to thi experi ar first keep the amount or weight you add to clamp constant and also perform more trial and chang your data would make the data more clear and accur .
4550	2	plastic type d consist can stretch the most accord to these two trial . therefor plastic type d ha the greatest stretchabl . p the student could have record of the plastic tap or not how mush weight thei were ad to the clamp .
4551	2	i think that plastic type a is the strongest plastic becaus it stretch the least in both trial on and two . thi plastic onli stretch an averag of mm . i conclud that the plastic type a must have been cross link . becaus it wa the strongest out of all four of the plastic . the experi could have been improv if thei put on more trial for each plastic type and if thei had a control variabl .
4552	2	the amount stretch with the plastic type act time in increas more and more . if thi could continu to happen the plastic will rip . p the student should it code more detail and inform to it so it would made a clear .
4553	2	base on the student data plastic type a is the strongest becaus it stretch the least . in trial it stretch mm and in trial it stretch mm . plastic type d stretch the most it stretch mm each trial . the student should start out with all the plastic the same length and thei should conduct more trial of for valid and accur result .
4554	2	base on the student s data we can conclud that plastic type b wa abl to stretch the most mm . while type a wa the least . overal the data wa accur both trial got around the same result . although a third trial would have increas the valid . also the procedur is vagu thei should have includ the differ type of plastic . the data tabl should also includ the start and end length of the plastic sampl .
4555	2	from the student s data i can conclud that plastic b stretch the most and plastic a stretch the least . p on wai the student could have improv their experiment design wa establish a control and do more trial .
4556	2	the student make a data tabl to test the four differ polym plastic or stretchabl . he di a data tabl he put the plastic type a b c d and the amount stretch mm t . and t . he us thi tabl to find hi answer . i think he could make a better explan about the test he wa suppos to show and explain .
4557	2	a . the polym with the most amount of stretchabl is plastic type b . p b . the group could have made sure each plastic wa the exact same length . the also could have specifi exactli how much weight to add befor let the plastic hang for five minut .
4558	2	type of plastic were test a b c and d . type a wa mm then it wa stretch to . type b wa than stretch to mm . type c wa than stretch back to mm . type d wa mm and it stai the same . next time he could have done anoth trial to verifi the result again . then extend the amount of time and weight compar the rd trial to the st nd trial and see the outcom .
4559	2	base on the student data the plastic type b stretch the most out of all of them . p the student could have us new plastic for the second trial and could have done more trial to verifi the result .
4560	2	base on the student data the amount stretch between test and test their isn t much of a differ becaus thei ar either off by on or two millimet or it didn t chang at all . two wai the student could have improv is ran more test and test more type of plastic .
4561	2	the conclus on base or the student s data is that b have the most amount stretch mm d have mm ll y mm a about stretch mm . p by tell us what type or plastic and by explain better how to do it .
4562	2	a the type b plastic wa the most stretchabl becaus the first test it stretch mm and the second it stretch mm . thi wa more than ani other plastic . p b the student could have ad on more test to the experi to get more accur data . also the should have had the same amount of weight on the plastic for more accur data .
4563	2	a base on the student s data plastic type b ha the most stretchabl out of these polym plastic and type a ha the least . b to improv thi experi the student could ve specifi how much weight wa ad to each clamp and he could ve ad a control group so he had someth to compar the result against .
4564	2	plastic type d stretch the most out of all of the plastic becaus it stretch mm in both t and t . plastic a b c stretch an averag of mm . mm and . mm respect . p on wai the experiment design could be improv is by specifi how much weight is to be clamp on the plastic in step to increas valid . also the length of the plastic should be kept constant throughout all the trial .
4565	2	a conclus that can be made from thi experi is plastic type b stretch the most becaus it stretch the largest amount in both trial with mm and then mm . thi plastic probabl is not the strongest becaus it stretch a lot . plastic type a onli stretch mm in the first trial and mm in the second trial . the student could have test the plastic with weight at variou amount of time not just minut . also the student could have test each plastic more than onc to increas the valid of the result .
4566	2	a base on the student data on could conclud that polym plastic b and d stretch more than a and c be stretch the most and a be stretch the least amount . p b the student could improv thi experi by measur the plastic normal as thei did but then wa complet stretch the materi by weight or by hand and measur if a complet stretch rather than after measur it . also becaus some result vari then thei could have perform anoth time to ensur accuraci and then find the averag .
4567	2	accord to the student s data type b stretch the most . in both trial thi plastic prove the most stretchabl . howev hi data is partial invalid becaus a if differ length plastic ar us a larger length will alwai be measur more than a shorter length plastic . also the amount of weight need to be constant becaus the amount of weight us can greatli alter how stretch the plastic .
4568	2	a in conclus plastic type a stretch the most and plastic type d didn t stretch at all . p b two wai the student could have improv is by do more trial and by sai the amount of weight that us on the plastic .
4569	2	a plastic type b wa the most stretch in t . p b these could have on the experi over to doubl check their work and made sure type c wa correct .
4570	2	on conclus that can be drawn is that plastic b is the strongest . two wai that the student could improv the experi design and or the valid is to specifi how much weight to add on the clamp and to make sure all of the sampl ar the same size .
4571	2	a . we conclud that plastic type b had stretch the further in both trial and trial . as you see in the data tabl plastic b stretch mm in trial and mm in trial . p b . two wai the student could have improv the experi design is by increas the amount of trial and have a specif number of weight instead of just ad a random amount .
4572	2	a . accord to the tabl between plastic a b and c the amount stretch increas by increas by on and decreas by but d stai the same . p b . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design ar more type of plastic bag and repeat the procedur .
4573	2	base on the student data polym plastic type b is stretch the most . plastic type b had the longest amount stretch . on wai the student could have improv hi experi is to have ad the same amount of weight to each clamp . anoth wai to improv the experi is to make sure all the plastic ar the same length in the begin of the experi .
4574	2	after read the student data on the polym investig i can conclud that plastic a is the strongest polym becaus it onli stretch mm in t and mm in t and plastic b is the most flexibl becaus it stretch mm in t and mm in t . two wai the student could have improv their experi is by ad a control to compar the result to and specifi how much weight to hang on the polym .
4575	2	a plastic b stretch the most follow by plastic d c and a stretch the least . p b measur the distanc the plastic is leap from the edg of the tabl and keep consist for all the plastic . specifi the amount of weight ad to the clamp and keep consist for all the plastic .
4576	2	base on the data polym b had the largest stretchabl . p b the student could have done on more trial to ensur accur result . make sure the tape is the same place for each sampl so that it give the same support and more accur answer .
4577	2	thei should make differ trial . p thei should us clamp it mass thing up .
4578	2	base on the data it is evid that overal plastic b wa the most stretchabl and plastic a wa the least stretchabl . polym a possibl ha a cross link structur sinc it is more rigid and strong while polym b is probabl liner or branch in structur . on wai the student could have improv the valid of the result could be to cut the plastic to equal size . thi wai length would be a constant . also the experi s procedur doe not specifi the mass of the weight if the mass wa kept constant for all of the test the result would be much more valid .
4579	2	base on thi student s data the plastic type b stretch the farthest while plastic type a stretch the least amount . to improv the student result it would be import to add a control to the experi . anoth wai to improv would be to add addit trial to the experi to increas the valid of the result .
4580	2	base on the student s data i conclud that plastic type b had the highest stretchabl becaus it stretch mm in t and mm in t which wa more than all of the other plastic type . two wai the student could have improv the experi valid of result could be to conduct a rd trial to get more accur result and specifi what polym plastic were us so that someon could accur the experi .
4581	2	a base on the data tabl if you add weight to plastic type while it is hang some of the thin plastic type will get longer . dure the time in the experi it doe not longer . p b in step four the student should have told you how mani weight to add to the type of plastic . the student should have measur the plastic befor thei stretch them . thi would help with the valid of the result becaus you will be abl to compar it regular length to the stretch length to help your conclus .
4582	2	a conclus that can be drawn is that plastic type b wa the strongest plastic . p thei can improv thi experi by have more trial . also thei can add more weight for anoth three trial to be sure that their result were accur .
4583	2	the student should of us a foam cup instead of a plastic on and also us beaker weight and a clamp that wa made for experi like these . it would of made is data come out with a lot of better result .
4584	2	b is the most stretchabl plastic out of all four . on wai to improv it is sai how much weight thei us on each on and if the chang it . the second wai would be to test four or five differ on .
4585	2	base on the experi i draw the conclus that plastic type a is the strongest . thi is becaus plastic type a stretch the least of all the plastic in trial and . to improv thi experi the student could do more trial thi would make their find more valid . also the student s don t provid the initi length of each piec of plastic which make conclus like mine possibl incorrect .
4586	2	in conclus plastic type b is the most that wa stretch out the all the other . someth the student could have done better is tell us how much weight he put them to make it stretch out .
4587	2	base on the student experi the conclus that can be drawn is that plastic b is abl to stretch the most millimet in both trial and . on wai the student could have improv the experiment design of their experi is by sai what size weight thei had us for each plastic . the last wai is by sai what type of plastic thei us .
4588	2	plastic d wa the most stretch . p the student could it should at the origin measur wa of the plastic befor stretch
4589	2	a in conclus the type of plastic that stretch the largest is b . the amount b ha stretch wa t and t . p b two wai thei could of improv their experi wa on add weight and repeat the trial a few more time .
4590	2	base on the data all four plastic for t is differ from t . each trial follow the same procedur . it should be right on the same amount that mean the trial is wrong . p b student can read and go through everyth to prove on their project . student should write down everyth that thei done each trial .
4591	2	plastic d stretch the same amount everi time . plastic a and b increas when thei stretch . plastic c decreas when it stretch . p the student could have done an experiment for each polym .
4592	2	a conclus base on the student data is that plastic b ha the highest stretchabl while plastic a ha the least stretchabl . two wai the student could have improv thi experi is by specifi the weight of weight and us the same amount for each trial . anoth chang would be to conduct at least on more trial these improv would greatli improv valid of the result .
4593	2	a . plastic type b is the most stretchabl of all the plastic while type a is the least stretchabl . p b . the first wai would have been for the student to have defin the weight of the weight . also the befor and after length of the weight should have been defin .
4594	2	my conclus on the student data is that plastic c alwai had the most stretchabl . wai the student could ve improv the experi wa to leav it hang longer and us a littl more weight .
4595	2	base on the data given by the student all of the plastic wrap stretch approxim the same amount for both trial and . on wai the student could have improv the valid of their result is by ad a section to the tabl that show what the start length of the plastic wrap were . anoth wai is that in the experiment design the amount of weight ad could have been more specif .
4596	2	plastic type a and c didn t hold veri well . howev plastic b and d held more . i sai that plastic b as the better solut and outcom to us becaus pt add more and pt ha a good stretch .
4597	2	a plastic type b ha the most stretch . p b the student could add more trial and the student could make sure to us the same size sampl for each trial .
4598	2	. a in conclus it show that plastic b can hold more weight than the other . trial onli stretch mm and trial stretch mm . p b two wai the student can improv is the number of weight appli to the plastic bag . also the amount of time it took for the bag to rip ad more time .
4599	2	a . base on the student result a conclus that can be drawn is plastic type b ha the highest stretchabl . p p b on wai the student could have improv the experi wa state mass of the weight . p p c anoth wai the student could have improv the experi wa to ensur the same mass of the weight were us for each type of plastic type .
4600	2	a my conclus is that t plastic type a will be b c and d . p b a wai the student could ve improv is by have a particular time limit for all of the trial . anoth wai to improv is by have a certain amount of weight so the data can be more accur .
4601	2	the conclus i can make of the student s data is plastic type b ha highest stretchabl and plastic type a ha the lowest stretchabl . thi experiment design could have been improv by let us know how mani weight he us for each plastic type . he or she also could have told us how long wa the length of each type of plastic wa us .
4602	2	the gradual increas with caution plastic a and b and c and d either remain the same is get chang . on wai to improv the experi would be to explain what type of plastic thei re us . anoth could be to repeat the trial more than twice .
4603	2	after read the student data i have come to a conclus that plastic type b stretch the most on both trial becaus it ha and which is higher than the other plastic type thei investig .
4604	2	in conclus if type a b c and d ar stretch then type b plastic will stretch the most sinc it stretch about mm . then the type a plastic will stretch the least sinc it stretch about mm on wai the student could improv design is do on trial without weight to assur the plastic will not stretch from graviti s forc or other element . next the student should have made each plastic the same length becaus with differ length a second length is present . final in the procedur the student should us the same amount of weight for each trial and plastic .
4605	2	plastic b is the polym plastic that had the biggest amount of stretch . on wai that could improv thi experi is when you and the weight us a certain amount a lot than next trial and more weight . anoth thing that can improv the result of the experi is to you do a third trial .
4606	2	on wai the student could have improv the experi is instead of perform a second trial exactli like the first on thei could have switch up a littl to make it more interest . anoth wai the student could have improv the experi is us other object other than onli weight .
4607	2	the student could have put more weight on the clamp to let the plastic be more stretchabl and it would get more big and it could hole more thing .
4608	2	type wa lower on number in mm compar to type but type wa more consist . also plastic b wa stretchiest . p the student could or improv by step it out to visual it better . also you can never for get label and variabl .
4609	2	a out of all the plastic b ha stretch the most and look as if it want go ani further . the least stretchabl is a plastic . p b two wai thei could of improv the experi is by do a t and or try differ amount of weight and ic if done more each time make a differ .
4610	2	plastic b is the most stretchabl plastic a is the least . the student should have chang the amount of weight put on each plastic . the plastic could have stretch more depend on how much weight thei can us . the student should also have done a control and let the plastic half with that the lamp .
4611	2	a conclus i drew about the student data is that plastic a stretch more in trial than trial . also that in trial plastic b stretch mm than trial . in trial for plastic it didn t stretch as much as trial at trial and plastic d stretch the same . the student could have improv their experi is by ad a clamp at the top and bottom of the plastic sampl . anoth wai the student experi could have been improv is try a third trial .
4612	2	a the conclus of the student result is that plastic type b wa abl to stretch the farthest without increas . p b wai the student could have improv their experi ar to sai what wait to measur the plastic in in the procedur . what the procedur you ar ad weigh .
4613	2	plastic type d stai the same throughout the trail . p the student could have improv the experi by be more septic with the weight ie ar thei g or g and explain how thei ar go to measur the plastic sampl .
4614	2	base on the student s data plastic type b is the most stretchabl follow by plastic type d then c and final a . the student could have made the procedur better if thei had specifi the origin length of the plastic and by ad on more trial it could have further solidifi their result .
4615	2	a in both trial on and two had stretch the less b had starch more than ani other in both trial . p the student could have improv improv the experiment design he or she could have ad the length thei start with . also thei could have made th length start the same . it would have come out better .
4616	2	in conclus plastic type d will be stretch the most in the data . i have found becaus in both trial it ha mm stretch . p two wai the student could have improv their procedur is by have the same type of length for each plastic type in the begin and second thei should reform the procedur at the same time as the other plastic .
4617	2	a base on the student result i can conclud that the b plastic is the stretchiest becaus it stretch the most when it trial trial length were averag . p b on wai thei could have improv their design wa to make sure the same weight wa on each plastic sampl and to do three trial for each plastic rather than two to make their result more valid .
4618	2	after understand the tabl i came to conclud that polym plastic a ha the highest stretchabl level . on wai thi lab can be improv is by take into consider the weight of the clamp that stai constant wen ad it to the calcul of the weight on the polym plastic . also more trial could or been done .
4619	2	in conclus type a is the strongest plastic and plastic type b is the weakest . type c and d ar in the middl but d is master and dose to b . p on wai of improv thi experi i could be testifi more plastic . also the student would of chang the same from to or ani other time .
4620	2	base on the data my conclus will be that the student did someth wrong with plastic type c and d . two wai thi experi could be improv is ad anoth trial and state the amount of weight thei us on the plastic .
4621	2	the data is inconclus becaus there is no control test in the experi . the student could have improv by includ a list materi . he she should also have been more specif such as sai be what unit to measur in and how mani weight to us and how big small thei ar . he she should have also had a control and label which type of plastic us .
4622	2	a . the hypothesi in thi experi can not be support becaus there wa not on state the plastic type that stretch the most wa type b which stretch an averag of mm the plastic that wa most resist to stretch wa type a which stretch an averag of mm . p the student could have improv the experiment design and or valid of the result by have more trial and by tell you how heavi the weight ar suppos to be .
4623	2	everyth went well and thei eat everyth the want . two wai that the student can improv on their experi is thei mayb do more experi instead of do . the next thing that thei can improv in is not tape the edg and see what happen when thei don t so that is what thei can improv on .
4624	2	a conclus base on the student data is t and t a b c and d whig a close . there in the same area . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is if thei were to let it hang then five minut and if you were to attach someth other then a clamp .
4625	2	a . the conclus is . p b . the student could have improv their experi by ad a weight to each trial thei do . thei can also compar both plastic to see which on is stranger or stretch the longest .
4626	2	plastic type d is the most stretchabl . the student could have shown the amount of height put on the plastic . also thei could have ad more trial to make their result more precis .
4627	2	a base on the student s data of the stretchabl of polym plastic d stretch the farthest . also the other plastic stretch mm more dure the second trial but plastic d remain at mm . p b the student could have improv in their experiment design and valid . for exampl in the procedur the student should have state more clearli whether he or she us the exact piec of plastic for each trial . also the student could have includ what each plastic wa .
4628	2	the conclus for the student s data is that slightli two went up on went down and on stood the same . first wai student could improv is by ad differ kind of weight . anoth wai is by chang the length of the plastic .
4629	2	a in thi conclus plastic type d stretch the least t and t time mm . then plastic type b which stretch about to for t and t . p b thei should have mention the safeti procedur what should be worn when do thi lab . thei should have also mention how mani minut each should have .
4630	2	the student could of done a graph to improv the experi design . the student could of also done an experi or mayb could of drawn the process .
4631	2	a i can conclud from thi data that plastic a is harder to stretch and that plastic b is easiest to stretch . p b two wai the student could improv the valid of the result ar to start with the same length of each plastic and to add equal amount of weight to each plastic .
4632	2	a base on the student data plastic . type d had most stretchabl plastic . type a had the lowest stretchabl . b on wai to improv the experi could be to have more that . anoth wai could be to manual stretch plastic rather than us weight .
4633	2	a base on the data the amount stretch wa not much of a differ . p b two wai the experi could have been made improv is thei could have made the trial longer and ad a rd trial . also thei could have us a control .
4634	2	the conclus that can be drawn from the data of the experi is that plastic b wa the stretchiest plastic of the four plastic . on wai that the student could have improv the experiment design is by do about three of four trial instead of just two . thi is becaus by do more trial you can see if you might have made an error compar in the experi if the data you collect doesn t seem reliabl . the second wai the student could have improv their experiment design is by identifi which polym plastic ar which . thi is import becaus peopl need to know the name of the polym plastic to be abl to understand the experi .
4635	2	my conclus from the data is that man time the plastic wa stretch the second time thei stretch longer becaus after the first time it wa veri loos and worn out . two wai thei could have improv wa by try third time but with differ object to stretch the plastic and by try differ plastic for each trial .
4636	2	base on the data shown plastic type b is the polym plastic with the most stretchabl . on wai the student could have improv the design of the experi is by then take each polym and see how much weight could be us to stretch it how far . on more wai to improv the flexibl of the experi is by make sure that the plastic is tape in the same flow . everi time so the amount hang of the tabl is constant .
4637	2	a my conclus base on these student data would be that plastic type b stretch the most on both trial . p b on wai thei can improv their experi is by again includ a control anoth wai is to add more time instead of let the plastic hang there for minut try like mr .
4638	2	i think that plastic b is the most stretchi becaus on trial it is the longest and trial . thei could ve said how much weight thei put on and thei could ve put how much plastic thei us .
4639	2	could at made a better chart or make a better wai to solv it .
4640	2	in conclus it seem that type a b had stretch about mm . type c d had other plan . for type c the tape shorten about mm and type d didn t stretch at all . p two wai . name the type of tape thei ar us . . add the measur in the tabl .
4641	2	i can conclud from the student experi that plastic type a is a lot stronger then ani of the other plastic becaus on the second trial it stretch a whole mm more than it did in the first trial . on wai the could have improv their experi is to do anoth trial . also thei could have ad the same amount of weight to each type of plastic to improv valid .
4642	2	a i conclud that the plastic type b wa strongest type d wa second third wa c and th wa plastic type a . p he should have record the length of the plastic befor the weight wa ad . he should have us all the same weight to screen the plastic .
4643	2	in thi experi it is shown that plastic bag b ha a higher stretchabl then ani other bag becaus in trial it receiv mm and in trial it receiv mm these amount of plastic stretch were higher then ani other bag . bag d wa the closest in rang to bag b receiv mm .
4644	2	a student perform an experi to see how the amount of weight affect the type of bag . the bag that work the best in both of the trial wa bag b it stretch to mm and mm . the bag that did the worst wa bag a . stretch onli mm and mm . the student could have improv their experiment design by sai what type of plastic thei were us . thei also could have made their result more valid if thei had a control .
4645	2	a conclus of those result is that type d plastic appear to be the strongest becaus it stretch the least and type a is the weakest becaus it stretch the most . p two wai thei could have improv the experiment design is by be more specif with how much weight thei should add in step . also the should have re test trial of plastic type c becaus their result show that it shrank instead of stretch which is imposs in thi experi .
4646	2	i conclud that plastic type b stretch the most in trial and trial . thei could have improv the design or valid by us weight that all weigh the same and by make sure that all four type of plastic were tape at the edg of the tabl in the same spot .
4647	2	a . plastic a is the best plastic to us becaus it is stronger than the rest of the plastic sinc it stretch the least . p b . . could have done trial instead of just . . said how much weight wa us on each plastic .
4648	2	a conclus that can be drawn base on the group data is that their result ar not veri valid but plastic type b wa the strongest . on wai the student could have improv hi her experi design is to be more specif and clear with hi her procedur . anoth wai thi student could have improv hi her experi is to conduct is trial instead of to get more valid result .
4649	2	the two wai the student have improv the experi wa to not repeat the trial for a second time .
4650	2	a plastic type b stretch the most . p b the student could have improv the experiment design by put the number and weight of the weight and putt the origin length of the plastic .
4651	2	the type a drastic appear to be the more resist to stretch while type b seem the most prone to stretch . to better improv the lab thei should us equal start length for all the plastic type . thei could also us a better adhes than tape so that there is less of a chanc the plastic might onli down and give inaccur result .
4652	2	nor .
4653	2	a conclus for the investig is that plastic type b is the most stretch . two wai the student could have improv the data would be either on trial is to have the plastic ar same size wai on plastic wouldn t have an unfair advantag over anoth . anoth wai is to get new plastic for the new trial so you wouldn t mess up the data with the alreadi plastic .
4654	2	polym plastic type b wa the most stretchabl . polym plastic type b stretch mm in it first trial and mm in it second . it stretch mm more than polym plastic type d which stretch the second furthest at mm in both trial . p the student could have improv the valid of the result by sai how heavi the weight need to be . the student could have also improv the valid of the result also by sai what unit to measur in so no on accident measur in the wrong measur .
4655	2	a conclus that can be drawn from the student s data is that plastic type b stretch the furthest in both trial . the student could have improv their experiment design by includ exactli how much weight to us instead of just sai weight . also thei could have wait more than five minut in order to get better result .
4656	2	he should control the amount of weight he is put on the plastic . he should also us differ type of plastic .
4657	2	plastic bag b wa the strongest bag while a bag wa the weakest . the student could of did more trial and tell us what he had to do keep the excrement go .
4658	2	a . base on the data receiv from the student tabl i can conclud that plastic type b wa the on that stretch the most . it stretch mm and . also plastic type a wa the best and bare stretch . it came in at onli mm and mm . p b . to improv the experiment design thei could have explain how to secur the clamp and weight to the plastic materi and thei could have told us how larg the piec of plastic must be to do thi experi .
4659	2	a conclus base on the student s data would be if we test four differ plastic to see which on had the most stretchabl then plastic b would stretch the most . p two wai the student could have improv their experi ar on thei could have repeat it a third time to make sure everyth wa correct and their were no anomali . anoth wai thei could have improv the experi is thei could have made sure thei had an equal amount of weight on each plastic sampl .
4660	2	base on thi student data on stretchabl of plastic i can conclud that plastic type b stretch the most or had the most stretchabl after be weigh down for minut . two wai thi student could have improv the experi and it result could be first us a set number of weight to add to the clamp not just ad as much as possibl . secondli the student should have made a control of how long each piec of plastic wa in mm befor it stretchabl wa test .
4661	2	a a conclus can be drawn that plastic type b wa the stretchiest base on the data and that it would be the most durabl . p b two wai thei could improv the experi would be to control the amount of weight ad and to control the length and width of the plastic . wider and longer plastic would most like be stretchier . so thi add anoth variabl to the experi . if more weight is ad to on substanc than anoth then the plastic would less easier .
4662	2	base on the student data tabl can conclud that plastic type b stretch out the longest than ani of the the plastic . two wai the student could have improv the experi is by first identifi what she us as weight to hold down the plastic and the second wai is to possibl do a third trial of do thi experi becaus the amount of plastic stretch wa so close in the first two trial .
4663	2	the second trial the length of cup increas compar to first trial . p the student could ve done more trial just to have better data .
4664	2	the conclus of these student would be that plastic b had the greatest stretchabl out of all the plastic with mm in trial and in trial . on wai the student could have improv the valid of the result would be to includ the actual total weight of the weight and that also that constant throughout the experi . the other wai to improv result would be to also includ the start weight or length of the plastic and keep that constant for all of the other plastic .
4665	2	a . base on the data gather the best polym in plastic a stretch abil would have to be plastic b becaus it stretch the most . p b . he could have improv it s valid by record the measur of it length befor he began the experi .
4666	2	i think plastic type b will stretch the most and two wai the student can improv thi is thei could do more trial and let them hang longer .
4667	2	plastic type b stretch the farthest becaus in trial it stretch mm and trial stretch mm . the student could ve put in the tabl mm per minut so it would be more accur or he she could ve made a graph to show per minut how each plastic stretch .
4668	2	it appear that plastic type b stretch the most while plastic type a stretch the least to improv their experi thei should have done a third trial and instead of attach a clamp to just on corner there should be anoth clamp in the other corner to make it even .
4669	2	base on the data tabl i can conclud that plastic a is the most stretchabl . on wai the student could have improv the experiment design is to measur carefulli and to conduct more trial .
4670	2	in the experi done by the student it appear that plastic type b wa the stretchiest on averag mm . wai the student would be make all the initi plastic sampl the same length befor hand and specifi how much weight to put on the clamp .
4671	2	a in conclus the experi work effect becaus for plastic type a and b the plastic stretch from mm in trial to mm in trial and plastic b stretch from mm to mm . p b thi experi can be improv by includ constant or a control such as the initi length of each plastic . the valid of thi experi can also be improv by includ more trial .
4672	2	a the student s data wa veri rel it show the type of plastic us and how much it had stretch afterward . their data for trial on wa close to their data for trial two . for exampl in t for plastic a it stretch mm in t for plastic a it stretch mm therefor their data wa accur . p b two wai the student could have improv the experiment design valid ar to add a third trial and to be more specif about ad weight . tell us how mani and how much thei weigh .
4673	2	after test differ plastic sampl two time ti find which on stretch the most we found that plastic b stretch the furthest mm . on wai the student could improv their design and or valid citi could be by name the type of plastic thei us . anoth could be by try the experi with differ size weight to see if that caus the result to vari .
4674	2	base on the data plastic b stretch the most mm . that prove that the polym ar ductil . the plastic that stretch the least wa plastic a but plastic c wa onli mm longer than plastic a . plastic d wa in between plastic c and b with mm stretch . there could ve been error with how the student clamp or pull the plastic . on wai the student could ve improv the valid of their result would be do at least trial . anoth wai the student could ve improv experiment design would be by in the procedur tell what plastic to us first .
4675	2	a plastic type b is the most durabl becaus it stretch mm the first time mm the second time . the averag is . mm which the greatest averag come all of the plastic type . p the student could have done more trial to improv the valid of the experi . the student could also make the plastic ar all of the same length to improv the valid also .
4676	2	in the student data all of the plastic type
4677	2	a i can conclud that plastic b d ar the most stretchabl becaus of the length of their plastic in the end . p b . thei should have made the procedur more clear . for exampl kilo on the procedur need to be more specif on whether or not the weight should stai remov . also thei should have kept all plastic in the experi the entir of the time becaus it wa mislead inaccur and logic to keep on out . add more trial would suffic .
4678	2	a plastic d and b ar weaker than plastic a and c . a is the strongest plastic and b is the weakest . p b the plan doe not mention how the plastic should be measur . also the plan doe not sai to us differ type of plastic .
4679	2	a . you can conclud that plastic b is the most stretchabl . p b . thei could have improv their experi if thei said haw much weight thei us and state the initi length of each plastic .
4680	2	a base on the student data i can tell that plastic type d is the most consist . it stai at mm s each trial . c is the weakest becaus in the first trial it held mm and in the second it onli held mm . p b two wai the student could have improv the experi is to do it for a third time and to sai the weight of each weight .
4681	2	polym investig draw a conclus base on student data .
4682	2	the conclus of thi experi would be that test two mostli stretch further like becaus the plastic is alreadi stretch from test on . p thei could have improv the experi by do both trial with the same time to see the differ between the two . also thei could have us differ plastic for both trial so it wasnt previous stretch from trial .
4683	2	a the conclus you can draw is that plastic type b ha the best stretchabl out of the plastic . p b the student should have said how long the plastic wa when thei first rip it off . the student could have us all differ length therefor make thi not valid . also the student could have done more than trial to make the experi more valid .
4684	2	see from the student data tabl a conclus i can draw is that plastic type d is the strongest materi and most stretch . p thei could have improv by us an addit step for record their data . also thei could have us the same length plastic to begin .
4685	2	base on thi data plastic b stretch the most sinc for both trial it stretch further trial ani other plastic . plastic a is the least stretchabl accord to the experi becaus for both trial it stretch the least . a wai to improv the experiment design would be to specifi the amount of weight so each plastic can receiv the same amount of weight . anoth wai to improv the experi would be to have each plastic start at the same length so then can better be compar .
4686	2	a a conclus of the data would be that sampl b is the on that stretch the most . also base on the experi plastic type a did the least amount of stretch and plastic type c didn t stretch as much rather sampl d did pretti well but it stretch the same amount both trial . p b the experi could have been better if it wa repeat again . it would have been better also if the plastic length would have been more specif .
4687	2	plastic type b ha the highest stretchabl becaus it stretch the farthest at mm and mm for five minut in trial and . plastic type a ha the lowest stretchabl onli stretch mm in and mm in t . the student could have improv the experi by make each plastic sampl the same dimens . also for each sampl the clamp and type should be part in the same spot height amount should be specifi .
4688	2	look at the data i cant see that the amount stretch onli chang by a littl but for plastic type d it remain the same in both trial . thei could have improv it by sai how heavi the weight should be . anoth wai the kid could have improv it wa to sai what type of plastic did thei us .
4689	2	the conclus that can be identifi from thi investig is that for the plastic type d in both trial the amount stretch were the same . two wai the student could ve improv hi or her experi is by expand the trial to see if thei turn out the same again . anoth wai is to add the same type of weight for each on or chang the place where the weight were put on the plastic bag .
4690	2	in conclus base on the data the best polym or plastic type would be plastic b becaus it stretch the farthest with the weight . on wai the could improv wa by reduc the time minut and instead repeat the weight three which each plastic type or thei could also done trial tape to the desk and trial hold by your hand .
4691	2	conclus plastic b stretch the most and plastic a stretch the least . two wai to improv thi experi would be to includ the origin length of plastic and also the weight of the clamp and weight .
4692	2	plastic type b wa the most stretchabl polym plastic and plastic type a wa the least stretchabl . p the student should have thi procedur us the same amount of weight on each plastic . also the student could have state trial that were longer than minut to see if time affect stretchabl .
4693	2	the conclus i can draw from thi data is that plastic type a wa the most stretchabl . it stretch mm . plastic type b wa at least stretchabl . p the ancient could have improv the experi by includ the amount of weight that wa clamp so the plastic . thei could have ad a control where were wa no weight ad to the clamp .
4694	2	a . plastic type b wa longest in length for both t mm and t mm . plastic c had mm in t and mm in t and plastic d had mm for both trial and . so plastic b would be the at least plastic for stretchabl . p two wai the experi can be improv is if thei includ what type of plastic each wa . and how much of a sampl of plastic to measur thei all should be same length and width .
4695	2	in plastic a the length went from mm to mm in plastic b the length went from mm to mm in plastic c the length went from mm to mm in plastic d the length stood the same . p he she should have ad in the materi also explain it a littl better .
4696	2	a . a stretch the most out of them all and d stai the same . p b . more trial and thei could of hang the plastic longer .
4697	2	their data wa success . the student could of have more plastic type . thei also could of had amount stretch more data on it .
4698	2	the student could have not us same amount of weight as the st so he should have done that . also he could have clamp and put the weight in differ posit .
4699	2	some of the plastic type have a littl differ amount stretch . from t to t and some don t at all . on wai the student could have improv the experi is or determin the amount of weight us in experi . also it would or been better is he perform a third trial .
4700	2	base on the data tabl type a wa the lowest number and b wa the highest . the student could ve improv the experi by mayb have a rd trial done . thei could ve also been more specif with the type of materi thei us . ex . dark tape scotch tape e . t . c
4701	2	thi experi show that ad weight to the plastic had veri littl effect on the plastic . these student could have told the amount of weight to add to the plastic in each trail . also the length of plastic thei us . a brand of plastic could have help becaus of it quilt te .
4702	2	in thi experi plastic type b wa abl to support most weight and plastic type a wa abl to support the least amount of weight . thi student could have improv thi do mayb a coupl more exampl so we could compel more . also thei could have done the experi to see how weight each plastic could support befor fall .
4703	2	if four differ polym plastic ar stretch to there maximum by weight than the matter at with the greatest amount of polym will stretch the most becaus the length result will prove each abil to stretch . thi conclud the data result to show that plastic type b wa test and proven to hold the most stretch . the student experiment design could have been improv by either inform the experiment exactli the constant length the plastic should be off the tabl or how materi .
4704	2	the student could have improv the experiment design by make a statement of how thei improv and wa it difficult as if thei had to do it more than time .
4705	2	a . even though both time each plastic wa test the stretch about the same length . all of them either stai the same of stretch an extra mm except for c which actual wa smaller than the first trial . p b . two wai the could have improv ar thei could have count how much weight it took to instead of stretch rip each plastic . a second improv would be to trial each on more than twice perhap three to four time .
4706	2	after test the four differ plastic for stretchabl the student found that plastic a stretch mm longer plastic c actual got mm shorter and plastic d stai the same length . i conclud that plastic a ha the most stretchabl and plastic c ha the least . in the experiment design the student should have told us how much weight wa be put on the plastic how far awai term the edg we ar to tape the plastic what measur we ar to us to measur the plastic .
4707	2	in conclus plastic type b stretch the most it stretch to mm the first trial and mm the second . plastic type a stretch the least mm . but in my second trial plastic type a stretch mm . but plastic type d didn t fall behind by much the
4708	2	a . in thi experi onli on object stretch out more after the second trial and that wa plastic type a and plastic type c didn t stretch more after the trial . it stretch less . p b he could of explain how mani plastic sampl he had . he could of the measur men of plastic s befor thei were stretch to show the differ and how much it wa stretch .
4709	2	a what i have conclud wa that plastic b wa the most stretchabl in both it trial . p b two wai the student could have improv the experi valid of the result wa make each plastic the same measur in length to better compar it with on anoth and state what type of weight were us to stretch the plastic gram pound and so on .
4710	2	plastic b b the most stretch at . mm averag stretch follow by d which stretch mm then c at an averag of . mm . the least stretch plastic is a have onli stretch an averag of mm . it can be conclud that in descend order the stretchiest b b follow by d then c then a . p the experi could be improv by cut the plastic piec to ident size to ensur strongest valid and util weight of equal mass so that all plastic experi the same downward forc .
4711	2	a polym a is the least stretch becaus the length of it at the end of the test wa the shortest . p i specifi how much weight is to be ad to the clamp . p . us a specif length of plastic at the begin of each test .
4712	2	the student gather veri precis data that thi the student s result for each plastic were similar in trial on and two . thi mean he or she did not make ani glare error in their experi . howev two wai thei could have improv their experiment design ar to includ the accept stretch amount for each plastic which would requir some research and to also includ the measur taken befor the plastic were stretch in their data tabl .
4713	2	first the student should take a sampl of on type of plastic and measur it length . second thei should attach a clamp to the bottom edg of a plastic sampl third thei should tape the top of the plastic sampl to a tabl so that it hang freeli down the side of the tabl . four add weight and clamp allow them to hang for five minut . five remov the weight and clamp measur the length of a plastic type . p b two wai the student could of improv the experi wa on thei should of explain there step better second put the plastic type in order .
4714	2	what i have notic is as the structur test the plastic type the amount stretch would increas and decreas each time . two wai these student could have improv the experiment design would be do anoth trial and ad more weight to the clamp .
4715	2	a . plastic type to would be best to us for stretchabl . p b . thei could ve improv thi experi by us the same length of plastic . also by get the time of how long the plastic stretch for .
4716	2	a the student s data reveal that plastic type b wa the plastic that stretch the most . p b the student could have improv the experiment design by includ what materi to us to measur the length of the plastic . the student could have also ad to us the same weight for each plastic to make sure thei ar equal stretch .
4717	2	a conclus the drawn is that plastic type a stretch the most and b stretch the second most while d stretch the same and c stretch . the student could have improv their experi by have three trial instead of thi on tell what type of plastic wa us instead of a b c and d .
4718	2	after the experi plastic d wa stretch out the most to mm in both trial . also in the experi plastic a stretch the least in test to mm and in test to mm . p the student could have made hi experi better by have all the same plastic at the same length and sai how much weight to put on the clamp . also to better hi result he could do more trial and averag the result to get accur result .
4719	2	a base on the student s data it is visibl that not everi plastic wa the same length . also the student probabl did not make sure that thei end at exactli five minut mayb five minut and a few second . b two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and for valid of the result is by make sure each plastic is the same length so all the data is accur . also to make sure there is the same amount of plastic hang off the tabl .
4720	2	in conclus plastic b wa the stretchiest becaus in both
4721	2	a the student can conclud that thei found out that some plastic stretch and other don t move . b the student could of improv thi by ad a lot more detail and probabl ad a hypothesi or thei could of done a differ method for stretch the plastic .
4722	2	a base on the student data we can conclud that plastic type d stretch the same a hunt in trial on and two . b the student could have improv their experi by state what amount of weight thei were us and what type of plastic thei were us also thei should have perform three trial .
4723	2	a . my conclus from thi student s data is that plastic b ha the most stretchabl becaus it stretch mm in trial and mm in trial which wa the longest that ani of the plastic were abl to stretch . p b . thi student could have improv their experiment design by tell us how much each weight that wa the ex stretch the polym . should weigh to make the lab more accur . also thei should have includ in the procedur that we were measur in millimet to avoid ani confus or inaccur result .
4724	2	plastic type b is the most rigid and flexibl of the plastic . p on wai the student could of made the experi better is by see which plastic stretch to it wai first . anoth wai the student could of improv is cut the plastic piec to the same length .
4725	2	in conclus plastic type a and b were stretch surprisingli type c stretch by a mm . type d just stai the same . p allow the weight to hang for longer . p test more plastic or heavier weight .
4726	2	a you can conclud that the type of plastic us for trial on t wa less stretchabl than the plastic us in the second trial . p b the student could repeat their experi . thei could also have a constant in us the same type of plastic thei us in each trial . thei could also make sure to mention what instrument thei us to measur the length of the plastic type .
4727	2	each type of plastic either stai the same or increas for mm . thi experi can be improv ad more weight let the weight hang on it longer than minut .
4728	2	base on the data polym b stretch the farthest becaus it consist stretch more than ani other polym . p on wai experiment design could be improv is to continu step and . a second wai is to add a start and end length to the tabl .
4729	2	thei could have put more stronger type of plastic and put heavier or light weight on it .
4730	2	a conclus plastic d is more effect the plastic a b c d . plastic b is also ha a good stretchabl as plastic as plastic plastic d best not as good . on the second trial . the stretchabl of the plastic improv . on the second trial plastic d stai the same plastic c depress by on mm plastic a b increas by on mm . on both trial plastic a had a low stretchabl . p b two wai the student could improv wa by sai how much weight thei were ad to the clamp and onli us on type of weight not weight .
4731	2	plastic type b would have more stretchabl than the other becaus the amount stretch is mm for the st trial but for the nd trial it which pare that thi polym plastic can stretch at a good amount . the student could ve made a more reason design that had less confus would explain it better .
4732	2	the conclus is some bag stretch more than other . on thing he could have improv on wa be specif on how much weight he put on each bag . he could of also ad weight for the second trail .
4733	2	i conclud that the plastic type that stretch the most wa type b . i said type b stretch the most becaus for both trial type b had the larger number . in trial it wa mm and in trial it wa mm . the student could of improv the experi by have the length of the plastic initi record so that you could compar them and also make sure for the nd trial that the start length wa the same length .
4734	2	in conclus plastic type be wa the strongest becaus in t it held weight . t it held weight . plastic a wa the weakest plastic becaus in t it onli held weight . t it held onli so plastic b would be the best plastic . p the student could of done a third trial see if result get higher . hang the clamp for about minut the probabl could of got higher result .
4735	2	the plastic that were chosen for the experi dont stretch veri much and if thei kept the weight on the plastic for more than minut then the outcom mai have come differ . anoth improv would be to add a heavier weight and see how long it take for the student to stretch and how long it stretch .
4736	2	in thi experi you ar abl to conclud that the plastic type a stretch the least which mean that it is the most durabl plastic out of the four . we should us plastic a becaus it is least like to break . two wai the student could have improv their experi is have a third trial to help them out . also to have a control group .
4737	2	what i got in conclus is that plastic type b got stretch out more than the other to improv thi experiment design wa us more detail like how much were the weight .
4738	2	from thi experi i conclud that plastic b is the stretchiest becaus it had a stretch of . plastic d had and the other were in ten two wai the student ca improv design is by test a third time to make sure there wa no mistak and let the weight hang longer becaus it could be that on of the plastic take longer to start stretch .
4739	2	a base on the inform plastic type b is the strongest and plastic type a is the weakest . p b two wai the experiment design could be improv is to tell us the exact type of plastic and how much did the weight attach to clamp weigh .
4740	2	the two wai that the student could have improv the experiment design or valid is to dire or mujib lie and of a .
4741	2	a . a conclus for the student data is when us the polym plastic type d . it stretch the same amount of mm . also that type b seem to be the best plastic becaus both time it wa abl to stretch the longest . p b . two wai thi experi could have been better is if the plastic were all start at the same time and if the first time befor the weight went on the student measur the start length of differ plastic .
4742	2	the student could have wrote down which plastic thei though wa go to stretch the most . and also thei should of wrote down the differ plastic name .
4743	2	a base on the data in both trial plastic type b wa to stretchiest polym plastic . p b . in order to improv thi experi the student should have more trial and thei could us variou size of weight .
4744	2	a my conclus base on the student s data to plastic type b and d stretch the most . for trail b had mm and d had mm for trail b had mm and d had mm again . p b on wai the student could improv the experiment design or valid of result is in the data tabl add how mani mm the plastic were befor the experi to see how much thei stretch over minut the second wai is in the data tabl . put in a column on how much weight thei us dure the experi that wai we can see how much weight it take to stretch the polym plastic .
4745	2	the result how that all plastic a through d stretch out after the weight were ad . howev there were some that stretch out more than other like plastic b . to improv the experiment design or valid the student could have mention in the procedur and us the same length of plastic for all type and trial . also thei could have kept the amount of weight constant through out the experi .
4746	2	in the data it is conclud that plastic type b ha the most stretchabl test at and mm . the data also show plastic type a ha the least stretchabl with test at and mm . the student could have improv the experi design by let more clear on the shape and size of the plastic befor the weight were ad . thei could also doctor in the weight of the clump .
4747	2	a plastic type b is the stretchiest while plastic type a is the least stretchi . p b the student could have done more trial . the student could have also let the plastic hang for a greater time to more accur test their stretchabl .
4748	2	a . plastic c is the most stretchabl . i stretch an averag of . mm while the other plastic stretch mm . mm and mm . p the student should have attach the plastic to the tabl with stretch more secur than tape . also thei should specifi the amount of weight thei ad to the bottom of the plastic and thei should make it the same for everi trial to their data accur .
4749	2	a the student data show that an averag plastic type b wa the most stretchi . p b the student could have improv by do more trial hold the clamp on the plastic longer .
4750	2	in conclus plastic type a the first time stretch mm the second time it stretch mm . plastic type b stretch mm second time mm . the plastic type b wa the most stretch . but plastic type d wa mm and the second time mm . d wa close to plastic b .
4751	2	plastic b had the most stretchabl in both trial with mm in trial a and mm in trial b . plastic a had the least with mm in trial a and mm in trial b . p on improv is ad a third trial becaus thei onli had two trial and anoth requir is take the averag of each plastic for comparison .
4752	2	a in conclus plastic b and d ar the more stretchabl plastic compar to c and a which ar less stretchabl . b be the most while a be the least . p b the student could have improv the experi design by make sure each plastic had equal length and mass also by ad equal amount of weight on a specif area of each plastic .
4753	2	a conclus base on the data is plastic type a stretch the least t t . plastic type b stretch the most t t therefor plastic type d ha best stretch abil . wai the student could have improv the experiment design wa to us differ becaus of plastic to see which brand is better and to sai how mani weight thei ar put on the clamp .
4754	2	a in the experi plastic b stretch the farthest at an aug of . mm . p b on wai to improv the experi would be to have a control or set length for the plastic instead of just sai ani length which can give invalid result . next i would improv the experiment design by control the of weight us as well as keep the weight as constant .
4755	2	a from look at the data i can see that plastic b stretch the most in both trial and plastic a stretch the least in both trial . p b on wai thei could have improv their experiment design would be to mai be do a third trial to see if you get the same thing thei could do is let the plastic hang for longer .
4756	2	a in conclus most of the plastic stretch or stai the same in the second trial . p b two wai the experi could have been improv wa to add more than two trial to each and to test less plastic .
4757	2	a my conclus base on these result is that plastic type b is the strongest . b to make their result bald thei should ve done more trial and possibl averag it out . plu a control would give them someth to compar their result to so thei re more accur .
4758	2	a from the data i ve conclud that plastic type b had stretch the most and mm . plastic type d stretch the same both time mm plastic type c stretch mm farther the first trial and mm and plastic type a stretch mm farther the second trial and mm . p b the student could have improv thi experi by show the origin length of the plastic in their data and specifi how much the weight weigh and what the differ plastic type were .
4759	2	in conclus the type of plastic for t had better result than t . two wai the student could have improv the experi is by write out the type of plastic and to put an equal amount of weight for each plastic
4760	2	base on the student data plastic type b wa the on that stretch the most after minut . as can be seen in the data tabl . it stretch mm in the first trial and mm in the second trial . the onli on that even reach mm in ani of the two trial wa plastic type d . two wai that the student could have improv thi experi is by tell them how mani time to cut the plastic if it wasn t the same size as the other so that there would not be differ size plastic . also the student could have said what type of weight and how much each weight weigh in the procedur so that the reader know what kind of weight should be us .
4761	2	a in trial on sampl a stretch to mm sampl b stretch to mm sampl c stretch to mm and sampl d stretch to mm . sampl b stretch to mm sampl c stretch to mm and d stretch to mm . p two wai the student could have improv the experi design is thei could have record their data and thei could ve tri each trial carefulli .
4762	2	a base on the result plastic b wa the stretchiest plastic . trial on it stretch to millimet and in trial it stretch to millimet . p b thi experi could have been improv by ad more wait ton the plastic to see if it might have been abl to stretch further . anoth wai is to add anoth trial to get veri accur result .
4763	2	plastic a b both gain a length plastic c lost a length and plastic d stai the same length . thei could have done more test with the plastic and us more plastic .
4764	2	the more the weight the less the rubber band stretch . the student could have given better inform . also the student could have given more instruct for the lab .
4765	2	in conclus to thi student investig plastic b could hold more weight for minut and stretch the longest in millimet for both trial . also plastic a had the lowest result throughout the experi . to give thi project a better score the student could have label what kind of plastic he us . the student could have written how much weight he put on each type of plastic to give thi realism .
4766	2	the conclus is that plastic type b stretchabl is the greatest where as plastic type a s stretchabl is the least . p thei could have improv the experi by ad the same amount of weight by each plastic and make sure that each plastic is tape at the same length on the tabl so that the tape or weight would not affect the stretchabl .
4767	2	in conclus base on data that the number didn t make so much up or down it s were veri close but t wa more accurst . it show that number were up except plastic type d . p on wai thei could have improv the design by elimin don t need it these second thei could had improv is by be more specif about number like how much length .
4768	2	a in conclus we can see that plastic type b is more stretch abl compar tooth type . in the two trial had and mm which is newest . p b on wai thei could of improv the experi is to do same more trial . anoth why to improv the experi is to special tell us how much weight on the end of the plastic
4769	2	the conclus that i can draw from thi experi is that some of thei plastic test weigh more than other and some after be stretch more then ar don t weigh as much . p two wai the student could have improv there experi would be to perform more than just to trail so thei could have compar the data . anoth wai thei could have improv would be to try more than just four type of polym plastic .
4770	2	a plastic type b ha the stretchiest polym type . p b the student could have improv the valid of the result by ad on more extra trial and keep the heavi of the weight constant .
4771	2	in conclus plastic type b stretch the longest in minut with mm in t and mm in t . the plastic that stretch the least with and mm is a . on wai to improv the experiment design is to hang a set amount of weight from the plastic by not do thi you don t know which plastic is most durabl . also you could be more care where exactli you place the clamp place it to high enabl the plastic to fulli stretch .
4772	2	a polym b had the longest increas in length with polym a have the shortest gain . p b he could graph the amount stretch by weight . p he could also perform more trial to get more accur result .
4773	2	a . plastic type b stretch farther than plastic type a c and d . it stretch mm in trial and mm in trial p b . on wai the student could have improv their experi would be to add differ type of weight small big . also thei could measur how for each plastic stretch everi minut and see which on last longer .
4774	2	a the flexibl of the plastic from most to least is b d c a . b and d ar probabl made of branch polym a made of cri link polym and c of either linear or cross link . p b the student should have record the amount each plastic stretch with differ weight hang from them . she could have also put the weight back on after the first five minut and observ how it continu to stretch record data at sever time interv .
4775	2	a the conclus that can be drawn base off of the student s data is plastic type b is the stretchiest out of the other plastic type . p b the two wai the student could have improv thi experiment design valid of hi result is by measur exactli the same length for all plastic so plastic star off longer than the other . secondli that could record how heavi enough weight is and how mani thei have ad to the clamp .
4776	2	in the conclus plastic type b stretch the most at of all the plastic . plastic type b stretch mm in trial and mm in trial . plastic type a wa the least stretchi becaus in trail in stretch mm and trail mm . the student can improv their valid by tell what the start length wa . also thei should of said how much weight to add .
4777	2	at the end of the polym investig type a stretch the most start with mm and stretch to mm . type d didn t stretch at all and type c actual got shorter start at mm and end with mm . two wai the student could have improv the experi is by start off with all the same length of plastic . anoth wai to improv the experi is by ad in the procedur how much weight to hang on the clamp .
4778	2	base on the student data i wa abl to com to a conclus see that plastic type a through c were abl to stretch decreas from both trial . now plastic type d wasn t it remain the same limit in trial as it react in trial .
4779	2	my conclus base on the student data is plastic b s stretchabl is more greater than the other plastic tast . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is thei could have two prop s stretch the plastic and measur at to see how long it stretch . thei could have also ad more weight to the clamp .
4780	2	a . the conclus i would draw base on the student s data is that plastic type b stretch the longest than ani other plastic . plastic type c stretch mm and then the second trial is decreas by mm . plastic type d stretch mm and for trial it stai the same . plastic type a stretch mm and increas by mm . p b . the two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is that be more precis will there procedur and name the plastic type . also tell us what to us to measur the length .
4781	2	accord to the data i have collect the plastic that stretch the most wa plastic b . plastic b went from mm in the first trial to mm in the second trial . plastic c realli ought my attent howev becaus it went from mm in the first trial to mm in the second mean it shrunk . some valid issu were that thei didn t tell you what kind of plastic thei us instead thei label it with letter . anoth valid issu is that the group didn t give the first measur of the plastic so you could see the chang in the first trial .
4782	2	i think it wa a lab that wa thei were do .
4783	2	after the polym investig i can conclud that plastic type a wa the strongest polym consid stretchabl . thi is becaus of the four plastic test a wa the least perman stretch and underw the least plastic deform . thi it is the most elast polym and b with quit opposit result the least elast stretchabl . thi experi could ve been made better by record the initi length of each plastic in the data tabl and by includ the averag amount stretch of each plastic to improv valid .
4784	2	base on the data plastic type b is the most durabl mean that it ha the most stretchabl . in trial b stretch mm . in trial it stretch mm . the student could have improv the experi design also the valid
4785	2	a accord to the data plastic type b could stretch the farthest and plastic type a could stretch the least far . p b on wai to improv the experi would be to add the weight to the clamp at time instrument rather than add randomli in a time period as minut . for exampl the first weight would get put on onc the timer start and after an second anoth weight would be ad and thi process would continu . thi would help the valid of the experi becaus it is to go the highest as a control result . anoth wai to improv thi experi would be to keep length of each plastic type constant . thi would keep the length as a control variabl and thu improv the valid of the experi .
4786	2	a in conclus in both trial plastic type a wa stretch the least and plastic type b wa stretch the most p on wai thei could have improv their experi thei could have ad more trial . anoth wai is that thei could have describ the weight a littl more in step so their experi can be repeat as similar as possibl .
4787	2	plastic type a is the least flexibl while plastic type b wa the most flexibl plastic . the student could have ad differ weight that mai have been heavier or lighter . thei also could have record the weight of the plastic .
4788	2	from the student result i can tell that plastic type b is strongest materi and plastic type a is the weakest . the student could have done on or two more test to further improv reliabl of their result and he she could have also written down the amount of weight put on each type of plastic that caus it to break .
4789	2	a . base on the record data of the polym investig experi i come to the conclus that that type b polym plastic had greatest amount of stretchabl becaus after all four of the sampl polym were test under exact same condit and sampl b stretch the furthest length a length of cm . p b . in step he should state that the weight must be ident as to ensur all plastic ar test in an ident manner . thei should also state in step on that plastic must be the same length . if the plastic ar shorter thei will actual be stronger due to leverag and that would affect valid .
4790	2	a conclus that can be drawn is that plastic type b can be stretch the further . the student could ve improv hi experi by ad more trial and find an averag .
4791	2	base on the student data from trial and it ha been proven that polym plastic b can withstand be stretch the digest . in both trial plastic b wa superior to the other by hold and mm in wright . these student could improv their valid and design by ad kei inform to the procedur . for exampl in step by give the exact dimens of the plastic be cut can allow all the trial to follow to be constant . anoth wai to improv you experi is to let the reader in step if you add the weight on at a time or all at onc and then let mm pass .
4792	2	a base on the student data plastic a in trial had mm went up to mm in t . plastic b trial had e went up to just in t . plastic c had mm in trial went down on to mm in t . plastic d stai the same for t t . p b the student should of tri anoth trial and thei should of also had anoth differ type of plastic .
4793	2	a in our conclus type b plastic work the best . it had the most stretchabl in both trial . p b thei could of made a graph for the experi to make it easier to dear starv .
4794	2	base on the student s data plastic type b wa the the polym becaus it stretch the largest . on wai the student could have improv their experi wa to write down how much each weight weigh for . also thei could of left the weight on the polym a littl longer .
4795	2	a the student improv their experi everi time .
4796	2	in trial polym bag stretch the most than other bag . p the student could have complet more trial . thei could of been more specif with the type of weight .
4797	2	my conclus base on the data provid is plastic type a had the best durabl becaus it didn t stretch as much as the other did . two wai the student could have improv the experi is by ad more trial to the process and to give brand name of the plastic .
4798	2	a plastic a and b stretch farther the second time but plastic c stretch less . plastic d stretch the same distanc for both trial . plastic d stretch the furthest out of all the plastic . plastic d is the stretchiest out of all the plastic and plastic a is the least stretchi . p b the student could have improv their experi by ad the same amount of weight to all of the plastic . thei could have also done anoth trial b to make sure their result were valid .
4799	2	nor
4800	2	plastic type b is the stretchiest type of plastic with t stretch mm and t stretch mm . temperatur the valid of the experi the student could have test the plastic with more or less weight attach . thei also could have mention the stretch over more or less time .
4801	2	a . plastic b wa abl to stretch the most . p b . more trial more type of plastic .
4802	2	. breed on the student s data the amount stretch mm ha more than . p two wai the student could have improv the experi could be us the same amount of weight put with differ type of object or whatev thei us .
4803	2	at the end of the polym investig the student data conclud that plastic type b wa the stretchiest plastic measur . on wai thi experi s design of result could ve been improv would have been to check the thick of the differ plastic becaus that would effect how for thei stretch . anoth wai thi experi could ve been improv would be to check the date at which the plastic were manufactur becaus after time and differ environ some materi mai be in better or wors condit which would affect it strength and stretchabl .
4804	2	a i conclud that polym b stretch the farthest trial and . also that polym a stretch the least farthest out of all the polym . p b there ar mani wai the student could have improv their experi . for exampl thei could have list the polym thei us . also thei could have done more trial .
4805	2	conclus base on the data found in trial plastic type b wa stretch the furthest and plastic type a wa not as flexibl as type b . p on wai the student could have better describ the procedur wa sai how much the wait weigh . and the student could have ad more trial to get better valid in the data .
4806	2	in conclus the student investig four differ polym plastic for stretchabl . plastic a in trial stretch mm and in trial it stretch mm . plastic b in trial stretch mm and in trial it stretch mm . plastic c in trial stretch mm and in trial it stretch mm and final plastic d stretch mm in trial and in trial it stretch mm . the two wai that the student can improv is add a control and more trial .
4807	2	i conclud that plastic type a is the best plastic becaus it stretch the least of all the plastic . thi show that it is the strongest becaus with the same weight thi on wa capabl of talk them the easiest . on wai thei could improv their experiment design is by make sure all of the sampl basi were the same length . thi is so we know the outcom isn t chang by the differ size . thei also should have said the exact weight of the weight so the experi could be replic .
4808	2	a . dure trial the result were about the same and the plastic contain stretch further then the first trial . p the wai the student could have improv the experiment design is by do the experi over again also the student could have us more plastic sampl for thi experi .
4809	2	a . plastic type b had the most stretchabl stretch mm on the st trial and mm on the nd trial . plastic type d had the second most stretch power follow by c and then a . p b . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and or valid of the result would be to conduct more trial for better valid and thei should mention the amount of weight in each bag .
4810	2	thi experi is us in mani wai and it is also a good wai to see which plastic wa the least stretchabl and which on wa the most stretchabl . on wai to improv thi experi is by sai the number of weight that should be put on . anoth wai is that it should sai much each weight ha to weigh .
4811	2	a for the most part in t the plastic type ar the same length or longer . p b . on wai the student could have improv the experiment design is by add about more minut to the second trial so see more of a length differ . for the result the student should made a graph to see the result better .
4812	2	to conclud plastic a is the best for stretch for exampl plastic a stretch to mm while plastic b c stretch to mm and plastic d didn t stretch . p thei could improv their experi by ad more trial and ad the same amount of weight to each type of bag .
4813	2	a base on the data i would sai that the test wa not as valid as it could be . p b to make it more valid thei could have said to get plastic sampl of all the same size becaus a bigger peac might hold weight better .
4814	2	conclus a student conduct thi experi in order to find out which of the four polym plastic can stretch the longest a b c d . look at the data tabl it show that polym plastic b stretch out the longest with a measur of . mm on t and a measur of mm on t . thi student could ve improv the experiment design by be more specif in step . by ad how long the sampl wa suppos to be . also for step by ad how much weight is need for thi experi .
4815	2	a . by the student hang the plastic sampl down the side of the tabl put a clamp on it and ad weight to it made the plastic stretch for a and b . for c the stretch went down mm and for d it stai at mm . p b . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design would be to add a third trial so we could see if the plastic would stretch more . also thei could have said how much the weight weigh becaus that could make a differ .
4816	2	my conclus from the student s experi is that plastic type d is the strongest becaus in both trial shown it wa stretch the longest . two wai thei could have improv the experi ar thei could have improv the experi ar thei could have done more trial for accuraci and thei could have includ the differ type of plastic us groceri bag sandwich bag plastic wrap garbag bag etc .
4817	2	thei should do a lot of trial on there experi . i think that the plastic type stretch the most out of all of them .
4818	2	base on the student s data i can conclud that plastic type a is the most durabl of the four plastic . in both trial it stretch the least mean that the polym stretchabl is not the great . on the other hand plastic type b ha the most stretchabl becaus it stretch out the most compar to the other three . if i were to carri a larg packag i would us polym b becaus it will not break and it stretch the farthest . two wai the student could have improv the valid of the result would be to write down the measur of each plastic with no weight and to conduct more trial . by do thi you ar show the comparison between befor and after and by do more trial you ar make your data more accur and valid .
4819	2	on conclus that can draw base on the data is the react the per data plastic type b wa stretch the longest amount of millimet . the student could have improv the valid of their experi by ad more trial so if can thei would do more data to support a by potenti . anoth wai thi experi could be improv is make sure that all of the plastic sampl ar the same length and weight becaus thei could also add or take awai from the stretch or some trial .
4820	2	a thei put a piec of tape of the the end of the tabl the part that wa hang thei ad weight the preced thi procedur twice and come up with cook below t succeed . p b thei could have test differ weight number or thei could of test the point of how long the tape wiz and how long it end up at the end with weight .
4821	2	a . base on the student data plastic type b stretch the most with mm . while the second close plastic which is d onli stretch mm . p b . the student could ve had more trial also a control to improv the experi .
4822	2	a conclus type b is the most weakest type c is nd strongest type a is the strongest . p b thei could have cut down on the time minut is a littl to much minut would be good and thei should have done more trial .
4823	2	the purpos of the lab wa to test four differ polym plastic for stretchabl . in conclus plastic b did inde held the most weight . in trial an trial . plastic b stretch mm and mm . the weakest plastic wa plastic a which in trial onli stretch mm and trial onli stretch mm . plastic c wa nd strongest stretch mm in trial and in trial . while plastic d wa the nd strongest stretch mm in the st and nd trial . two wai the student could ve improv the experiment design ar he could ve had longer time period to hold the weight and he could ve more than trial .
4824	2	a base on the trial from the student
4825	2	a plastic type b stretch the most while type a stretch the least . p b the student should have us the same amount of weight for each on . the length of plastic on should be the same . the amount of tape us should be the same constant could had a control group .
4826	2	in conclus if you test four differ polym plastic for stretchabl plastic type b stretch an averag of . mm while plastic type a stretch an averag of plastic type wa . mm and plastic type d wa mm . on wai the student could improv the experiment design ar more accur . also the student should have includ measur in their procedur we know the plastic start length and the amount of weight ad .
4827	2	a . the student have conclud that plastic sampl b is the most durabl with and mm in both trial . the least durabl plastic sampl would be plastic sampl a becaus it onli got and mm between both trial . p b . two wai that the student could have improv their experi would be to specifi the amount of weight thei ar ad in the clamp . final the student should perform more trial so thei have the best result .
4828	2	in result plastic type b ha stretch the farthest type d stretch the second farthest type c stretch the third farthest and type a stretch the smallest . in conclus plastic type b length wa the most t and t .
4829	2	a base on my data chart i found that plastic sampl b stretch out the most out of the four plastic i sampl .
4830	2	. the student should make a differ data tabl and not the same so the experi could show that is show a differ wai of the procedur . p . i think that the step of the procedur should includ more detail and have a close conclus to show how the experiment group had end .
4831	2	base on the student s data i am abl to conclud that plastic type b stretch the most out of all the type and therefor is the most stretchabl . on wai the student could have improv the experiment design would be to test differ amount of time be stretch . anoth wai would be to do an addit trial so it would be instead of increas the valid of the result .
4832	2	plastic type b snatch the most us thi experi . on wai to improv the result would be to do anoth trial becaus the inconsist result could be settl by a third trial . anoth thing to improv the experi would be to have equal mm length of plastic and then have the weight clamp stretch becaus that could have an effect such as the sens weight pull down so all sure length of someth like mm .
4833	2	a . a student perform the follow investig to test four differ polym plastic for stretchabl . in conclus type b stretch the longest length . p b . two wai the could improv the experiment design is by tell what brand the plastic is and by tell how much the mass of weight and keep constant and more trial .
4834	2	a after thi experi the data show that in both trial plastic type b wa the plastic that had the most amount stretchabl . the chart show that plastic b stretch mm in trial and mm in trial . thi wa the most length ani of the four plastic stretch . so plastic b would ve be most stretchabl . b howev thi experi could be improv . first of all he could have been specif by state in hi procedur how much the weight wa and how mani . for exampl record how much the plastic would stretch befor it broke . secondli the student should have state in the data origin length and the length it wa affect weight .
4835	2	base on the student data i can conclud that most accur plastic type wa d the amount stretch o for t and t mm . p two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is that thei should have done trial so it can be more reliabl and thei could have drawn a graph to have more valid .
4836	2	a . in conclus plastic type b wa the stretchiest plastic for the trial . plastic b stretch mm for trial and mm for trial while plastic a stretch onli mm for trial and mm for trial . p b . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design could be in the procedur to tell how much tape to us to hold down the plastic and to tell us if you ar suppos to us the same piec of plastic for trial or a differ piec .
4837	2	a conclus base on the student s data is that plastic type stretch the most accord to the two trial . on wai the student could have improv the experiment design wa to provid the begin length befor the plastic is stretch becaus it is import to see in comparison to no begin length how much it stretch . on wai the student could have improv the valid of the result wa to conduct a third trial becaus plastic a b c all had differ stretch amount in millimet from trial to trial
4838	2	accord to the result of the lab plastic type b stretch the most stretch mm on trial on and mm on trial two . plastic type a is the most durabl stretch the least plastic type a stretch mm in trial on and mm on trial two . p the design of the experi could be improv if more type of plastic were us in the experi . p the valid of the experi could be improv if the student specifi the exact type of bag thei us in the experi glad sandwich bai .
4839	2	a polym a is more durabl becaus it stretch the least on the trial . p b the student should do more than trial . thei should also measur the arm . of weight thei re put on the plastic as it wa not specifi .
4840	2	when process through thi experi most plastic at the end show improv . plastic type d wa the onli on that didn t chang it length . in the second trial plastic c went down from mm to mm . and plastic a b rais up two measur . thi experi can be re capabl but it wouldn t turn out as the same measur . thei student could of explain correctli what you had to repeat and do with the other three plastic . and at least name the plastic to give you more understand and knowledg to improv their design .
4841	2	base on the student s data polym plastic a ha the highest tensil strength with an averag of onli mm stretch . the next closest and strongest is polym c with an averag of . mm stretch . d is the weakest than those two with mm stretch and the weakest polym plastic is b with . mm stretch on averag . on wai thi experi could have been improv is to specifi how heavi the weight were constant . also to increas valid the student could have had all the polym plastic stare thi experi as all the same length and width mayb thi would affect the abil to stretch .
4842	2	the conclus i reach us the student s data is that plastic b stretch the most to millimet while plastic a stretch the least at onli mm . on wai thei could have improv their experi would be to specifi how trendi the weight should be and how long each piec of plastic should be . the second thing thei could have done wa conduct a third trial to make sure their data is valid .
4843	2	base on the student s data polym b it the weakest polym becaus it stretch the most . on wai the student could improv thi experi is by have more trial . more trial will give the student more valid data . anoth wai the student can improv thi experi is by test the strength of the polym with differ amount of weight . have heavier or lighter weight could tell the student exactli how much weight the polym can withstand befor it break .
4844	2	a the stretchiest type of plastic is b . the least stretchiest type of plastic is type a . b the student could ve heat the plastic piec a littl bit call to the same temperatur so that hi observ would have been more notic . he would also want to make sure that in the begin all the piec of plastic had the same length and thick .
4845	2	two wai their investig would improv is by ad the control the weight .
4846	2	plastic type d is the strongest . thei could have told us the conclus . thei could have also made the data tabl easier the read .
4847	2	a . the conclus would be that even though thei stretch some look to short . but impress becaus b and d plastic type stretch a lot . p b . the student could have improv by us more weight or heavier weight . instead of us the tabl as the base the student could have done it in a total differ wai like us hi hand or hang it from the window or roof .
4848	2	at the end the student can conclud that plastic type b stretch the most . also two wai the student could have improv their experi result is by ad a third trial and by make sure the same pressur be put to stretch each plastic is us each time .
4849	2	a i conclud that plastic type b had the most stretchabl due to the fact that it ha higher number on both trial . p b on wai the student could have improv the experiment design is by try differ type of plastic to see the stretchabl compar to each other . anoth wai thei could have improv it is by tell us the amount of time thei stretch the plastic for .
4850	2	a . the student mai have had a few error between trial to get such differ result except for d . p b . the student could have said how much of the plastic should be tape down becaus otherwis the differ of plastic tape down can chang the trial length . thei should have us someth differ than a clamp becaus the clamp could potenti break off a piec of plastic .
4851	2	a . my conclus is that plastic type b ha more stretchabl than the other plastic type becaus in both trial plastic type b had more stretchabl than the other plastic type . p b . the student could have improv their experi by perform trial instead of . thei also could of did a line graph instead of a two tabl so that peopl could get a better idea of how much the plastic type stretch .
4852	2	plastic type b stretch the most . the student could of improv the experi by ad more trial and by give the name of the plastic .
4853	2	base on the student data it can be conclud that in order from most stretchi to least it would be type b d c then a . type b had a higher stretch averag of . m while a had a low aug . at . thei could have improv valid by measur the over interv of line for exampl thei could have it everi minut for minut . and thei could have improv the experi by us the same length for plastic a b c d . instead of just measur the sampl .
4854	2	a plastic type b wa the the most stretchabl stretch mm . plastic a wa the least stretchabl onli reach mm when stretch . p b the student should have measur the length of the plastic and not them . in the same length so the peopl follow it won t have to have more measur and confus . next the student should have ad the same amount of weight and same measur of weight to each clamp becaus g would stretch plastic less than g so the date might not be reliabl .
4855	2	the second trick t stretch move than t . p the student didn t tell us what kind of plastic to us . thei didn t sai how much to put on
4856	2	a a conclus i can draw base on the a data is that in the second trial it didn t stretch that much father than the first trial . p b two wai the experi could have been improv is if thei us differ type of plastic and measur which ar stretch the most . anoth wai is thei should have ad the same amount of weight .
4857	2	by ad weight to a plastic cup with a clamp under for a certain time thei found a measur of the plastic . p to improv the experi thei could have determin what kind of plastic . thei also could have let it hang for a longer time .
4858	2	a conclus that could be drawn from the data is that plastic type a had the best result and there stretch the most in both trial . two wai the student could improv the experi is by repeat the step again and have a rd trial for better accuraci and then even add in anoth plastic type to realli see which kind stretch better .
4859	2	base on the student s tabl i d conclud that plastic a is the least stretchiest . it onli stretch to be mm the first trial and mm the second trial . also that plastic b is the stretchiest see that is stretch to mm t and mm t . the student could have improv hi her experi by set a specif length to start with for each plastic to allow reader to see the differ . also the student should specifi how much weight to add and the weight of the clamp .
4860	2	the conclus of the student s data is that plastic type b stretch the most . it s first trial it stretch mm and the second trial it stretch mm . plastic type a didn t stretch the most . it onli stretch mm on it first trial and mm on it s second trial . p two wai the student could of improv their experiment design would be to do a third trial and have the clamp attach to the plastic for minut instead of the minut .
4861	2	a . although certain plastic ar differ you can onli stretch them so far . also with stretch the same type of plastic twice . the measur is not gonna chang drastic alli . p be you could add anoth trial to creat a more accur data form . also you could lengthen or shorten the amount of time you ar stretch the plastic .
4862	2	the student data show that the most stretchabl plastic is plastic type b . two wai that the experi could have been improv is to do it again . also the student should have made sure all of the plastic were the same length befor experi on it .
4863	2	base on the student data i can conclud that plastic type b stretch the furthest and plastic type a stretch the least furthest . the student could have improv the experiment design by do more trial of each and then find an averag . she also could have made thing more constant and specifi by state trial as the amount of plastic us to be held down to the tabl or how heavi the weight were .
4864	2	a a conclus base on the student data is that plastic type b stretch the farthest in both trial . p b the student could have improv the experiment design of the valid of the result by do more trial and by ad anoth control .
4865	2	the conclus to that the type a plastic stretch more than the other becaus stretch more mm than the other on .
4866	2	a plastic d stretch the furthest . p b the student should have includ the start length and width . these both should be held constant . also for each trial the student should make on trial have a weight of . thi give the experi rang for more variabl and accuraci .
4867	2	a base on the data the plastic type b stretch the most . p b thei should have said to make all plastic same length p should have specifi the amount of weight .
4868	2	a . plastic type d had the greatest stretchabl . p b . to improv the experi design and or the valid of the result of thi experi the student could have ad more constant variabl . constant variabl ensur that your data is valid by improv your experiment design with the same procedur . also a control could be ad . a control allow student to compar their data to the normal standard independ variabl onli . these factor improv an experi .
4869	2	a after perform the experi the student could conclud that sampl b wa the most stretchabl reach mm on the first try and on the second and that sampl a wa the least stretchabl reach mm and mm . p b thei could have explain what kind of weight to us and thei should measur it while it hang so thei know for sure how long it can stretch
4870	2	b . us the same but not us polym plastic becaus the on that were us alreadi were be test dure the experi and thei us them again for the second trial so us the same but new polym plastic . p also to add the same amount of weight for the plastic and to do anoth trial with more weight .
4871	2	my conclus to thi student s data would be that plastic b had the most stretchabl . on thing i would chang in the experiment plan would be that i would of us onli on type of weight brand is to us as my constant control the their thing i would chang is i would let t sit for min and see if there is more of a chang in data .
4872	2	base on the data plastic type stretch the most it stretch to mm as the first trial mm on the second trial plastic type b stretch the second most . p b . state how much weight could have a stretch us and the plastic ar be us .
4873	2	each plastic type stretch more than the previou on . type a and c seem to be the strongest becaus thei onli stretch and inch while b and d stretch and inch . two wai the student could have improv the experi ar to have a third trial and be specif on how much weight the student ad .
4874	2	the conclus base on the data is that plastic type b ha the most stretchabl becaus it stretch the greatest while d wa the second most c wa the third most and a wa the least stretchabl . the first wai thi experi could be improv is if each type of plastic had the same specif start length so that on length didn t stretch easier than anoth . also the weight ad to the clamp should be identifi specif so the experi can be repeat .
4875	2	the student could have perform more trial . p the student could have us more than on plastic .
4876	2	a . the student can conclud that plastic type b is the most stretchabl and plastic type a is the least stretchabl . plastic type b stretch the most while plastic type a stretch the least . p b . on wai the student can improv their experi is by state the amount of weight in pound in step . it is import to know how much weight is be ad . a second wai to improv the experi is by do addit trial with heavier weight in order to see how much the plastic can stretch .
4877	2	a base on the result i ve conclud that plastic b can be stretch the most . p b on wai to improv the valid of the result is to make sure the start length for all four polym ar the same . the second wai to improv the valid is to us the same amount of weight for all four polym .
4878	2	i can conclud that plastic type b ha state the most becaus . two wai the student can improv their experiment is to name plastic and have constant in their experi .
4879	2	a it seem that the result make sens . plastic b d were clearli the most flexibl and the other were not . b wa the most flexibl altogeth . p b he could have had a control to base the experi off of . he could try differ amount of weight on the plastic .
4880	2	a after try out all the polym plastic twice first trial the highest it a stretch wa while the second trial wa differ the highest it stretch wa . thei were both plastic type b . it seem like it stretch more on trial but also less and equal for the other type of plastic . p b on wai thei could or improv wa to do third trial . p second wai explain how much weight do we need to us .
4881	2	how doe t affect t . my conclus plastic b ha more stretchabl then the other .
4882	2	from look at the result of the polym investig lab i conclud that plastic type b ha the most stretchabl in both trial it stretch the most out of all the other plastic . p on wai the experi could be improv if at the begin of trial all the plastic ar cut at the same length . if thei start off be the same length compar the result would be easier and more accur . anoth wai to improv the lab is to us someth stronger than tape to hold the plastic . with tape the plastic a the weight most like even fall .
4883	2	base on the student s data . i can conclud that plastic b had the most stretchabl . i can conclud thi becaus in both trial and the plastic stretch more than the other . the student s could have improv the experiment design . on wai is thei could have ad more trial . anoth wai is thei could of said the type of plastic thei were us . thi is how thei could of improv their experiment design .
4884	2	thei should of name the differ type of plastic and could of doubl check there measur .
4885	2	base on the student data plastic type b wa abl to be stretch the most . two wai that the student could have improv hi result and the experiment design wa by time the time it took for them to stretch and chang it either shorten it or rais it . also the student could have drawn a graph to better valid their result .
4886	2	a base on the student data the plastic didn t have much of a differ from trial to trial . p b the student could have improv the experiment valid by measur each plastic the same length and ad more trial .
4887	2	in conclus out of the type of plastic us for the experi plastic type b stretch the longest . the data show that from trial and plastic type b measur ton and . two wai a student could have done to improv the experiment design is perform at least or more trial becaus the result mai not be credibl . also i would measur the weight put on the plastic to make sure it done evenli .
4888	2	a plastic type b is the most stretchabl plastic type . a is the least stretchabl . p thei could have done more than two trial .
4889	2	for t and t for the type of plastic it stai around the same area in mm . so i think the amount stretch is correct . p b two wai the student could have improv the experi is by mayb the nd time leav it longer than five minut . anoth chang could have been to see what made it differ the second time .
4890	2	a base on the result plastic type b had the greatest elast with an averag length of mm . the least elast plastic wa plastic a with an averag length of mm . p b . make all plastic begin at the same length . p . specifi how much weight is to be ad and make it a control variabl .
4891	2	a the result rang veri close in number from trial and but plastic type d stretch the most . p b the student should have done at last on more trial and could have averag cut the result for each plastic type .
4892	2	plastic type b ha the most amount stretch where plastic type a ha the least . the student could have improv her experi by be more clear when it came to the procedur and by organ the procedur .
4893	2	a . there is wide variat in the stretchabl of these polym . b . thei should have us a set amount of weight instead of vari it . thei should have put the polym to a specif site . for exampl all polym should have been cm by cm by cm . thi wai you elimin variat .
4894	2	plastic b wa the most stretch on both trial therefor i conclud that it is the most stretchiest than the other . plastic a wa the on that less stretch and there fore is the less stretchiest of all . plastic a is the strongest becaus it didn t stretch fastest and b is the weakest becaus it stretch the most in minut . the student could have done anoth trial . the student as well have done differ time period such as minut . th student could have also sai the amount of weight put on .
4895	2	a could conclus could be that plastic type d had the most amount that wa stretch . p also two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is p . let the weight hang longer . p . more trial .
4896	2	after hold weight the plastic ha stretch to be longer . p alwai ar how much weight and ran more trial .
4897	2	a in conclus plastic d is harder to stretch than plastic plastic a . plastic d stai the same as plastic a stretch mm more dure t than in t . p b the student could have improv their experi by ad a third trial and along us averag to base their find off of . also thei could have said how much weight to add in each plastic .
4898	2	the student s amount were not that far apart from each other thei were off by or until d when thei were both equal with . wai thi student could ve improv the experiment design wa to do the second trial a littl bit differ from the first trial to get better result and increas the time on mayb how long the student had her sampl hang .
4899	2	in conclus more of the t have a high record then t . two wai improv the experiment ar measur length differ and type of plastic .
4900	2	to let the plastic hen longer put more weight on it .
4901	2	the student to test the stretchabl of differ polym plastic by take a sampl of on plastic measur it and and then tape it to the tabl and ad weight to the plastic and let it hang for min then measur the end length . the student notic that plastic be did the best in both trial with mm in the first and mm in the nd . plastic d wa the next best with and follow by plastic c . plastic a did the wors with mm and mm . two wai the student could be improv their experiment design wa to sai the start length and how mani weight wa us .
4902	2	a plastic type b wa the most stretchabl plastic out of four plastic a b c d materi and plastic type a wa the least stretchabl plastic . b the student could have improv the experi by repeat the exact same experi again . the student could also have compar to other student who have done the same experi to see how accur differ thei have .
4903	2	a plastic a c ar the least flexibl while b c ar the most . p b thei could have done anoth trial ad a variabl
4904	2	a conclus base on the student data is that thei were try to see which plastic is the strongest . the strongest is plastic b . p two wai that the student could have the experiment design is by put the more of the plastic . also put the time .
4905	2	two wai that the student could improv hi experi is by first do a few more than just trial mayb would be good . also make sure that all the plastic sampl ar the same length befor stretch .
4906	2	plastic b is the most stretchabl plastic . the student could have improv the experiment design by us more detail . the student could have improv the valid of the result by .
4907	2	thei could ve measur or weigh how much weight thei were go to add .
4908	2	a . sampl b and d perform about twice as well as sampl a and c . p b . the student could have describ how the weight should be distribut and how should the tape be put on the plastic wrap at the top .
4909	2	base on the data chart the conclus that can be drawn ar when the plastic type d wa stretch both time dure the trial thei stai the same . two wai the student could have improv thi experi is by do anoth head so their data can be accur and us differ type of plastic .
4910	2	a a conclus to the student data is the more the plastic type wa put the long it stretch . p b the student could of did make trial also thei could of took the three highest stretch plastic and did a experi find out which plastic stretch the longest out of the three .
4911	2	base on the data of the student plastic type d ha the best stretchabl and plastic type a ha the worst to improv the experi the children should have measur a plastic bag without clamp as a control to compar data also anoth wai to improv or valid data wa to do anoth trial .
4912	2	a plastic type a seem to be the most durabl judg by the fact that it onli stretch mm in total . p thei could have ad more trial and thei could have specifi if thei ad the weight in the same order everi time .
4913	2	if he didn t do the same exact trial twice then he wouldn t get almost the exact same data . on wai he could on chang it is by do a differ trial . should of told us what ar the polym plastic for stretchabl .
4914	2	a . plastic type b is the most stretchabl . p b . add a control specifi how much weight to put on the clamp .
4915	2	base on the result of the student data result it is clear that no on of the polym had much of a differ concern how much thei stretch the most on polym wa mm which isn t that much . to improv the experi the student could have us heavier weight for a more accur measur . becaus the weight that were us didn t seem to have much of an effect . the student also could have found out what each type of polym wa befor thei start their experi .
4916	2	a base on the data plastic b wa the most stretch capabl plastic and plastic a wa the least stretchabl a wa the least stretchabl . p b two wai the student could have improv the design would have been by measur the length of the plastic type befor remov the weight and by perform a third trial to valid the result .
4917	2	the experi isn t valid becaus there ar i v s which mean you can draw the conclus becaus thei stretch the same plastic . i i be so it you draw a conclus you draw the differ between the two trial but other than that you can t draw the conclus . if thei would have how did the second trial when it would have work .
7439	3	panda in china and koala in australia ar the same becaus thei both onli eat on type of food which is bamboo and eucalyptu leav . thei re both differ from python becaus thei don t migrat from place to place . also thei re both not as threaten as a python .

13521	5	after mrna leav the nucleu it then attack to the dna then the dna unzip then the protein detach and then you have protein synthesi .
13522	5	mrna leav the nucleu and goe to trna and trna send whatev messag mrna give it to a cell in the bodi . thi is how mrna get messag to other part of the bodi .
13523	5	. anaphas . interphas . metaphas . prophas
13524	5	protein synthesi ha major step involv . the first on is the mrna leav the nucleu . mrna is consid the messeng . mrna carri instruct for the amino acid sequenc that is shown in a protein . onc the inform get to where it is need the cell us it to make a protein .
13525	5	mrna goe out into the cytoplasm and into the ribosom to the nucleu to the nucleolu
13526	5	the mrna match up with the rna and creat protein .
13527	5	the four major step involv in protein synthesi ar travel to the nucleolu ribosom ar develop the mrna travel to the nucleolu to give it instruct to make a ribosom .
13528	5	mrna send a massag to the nucleu sai that it is time to divid . rrna trna transfer the dna to the new cell .
13529	5	as the mrna leav through the pore of the nucleu it travel to the ribosom or amino acid . at the ribosom the mrna put the protein and inform . after the ribosom or amino acid have that the inform is evenli distribut and the cell begin to split . the cell then is pinch in the middl to make two new cell .
13530	5	mrna leav the nucleu . trna transport . rrna produc ribosom .
13531	5	. help your muscl . keep you from german sick
13532	5	the mrna leav the nucleu and becom a trna and then it travel across the bodi
13533	5	prophas metaphas telophas and anaphas
13534	5	the nucleu send out order to make out protein . the mrna carri those order and instruct for the protein . then the mitochondria make the protein and then the protein ar transport other part of the bodi where thei ar need .
13535	5	mrna leav the nucleu goe to the lysosom give them the code assembl the protein and trna take it awai
13536	5	then it the rna protein amino acid and sugar .
13537	5	onc the mrna leav the nucleu the cell divid it ha the same dna the cell grow and matur and then divid do the process over again .
13538	5	after mrna leav the nucleu
13539	5	the m rna travel along the rough er and then travel to the golgi apparatu and get shape off from there .
13540	5	mrna take the code for the amino acid to the ribosom . thi is where the construct of the protein occur . rrna copi on strand from the origin and trna take the new materi to the nucleu where it match up accord to the new code that it ha form . thi new rna ha both an origin copi strand from the first code and a new strand as well .
13541	5	it leav the nucleu then goe to the nucleu the nucleotid and then it goe to membran
13542	5	anti codon match up with codon then ribosom ar made and then protein ar made .
13543	5	the four major step involv in protein synthesi is grow drink water and pat right .
13544	5	on mrna enter the cell . two mrna move around in the cell . three mrna enter the nucleu . four mrna leav the cell .
13545	5	mimi so
13546	5	protein photosynthesi start by leav the nucleu . after it leav the nucleu it get transport to the cell wall membran to be flush out of the system . onc that ha been done the mrna goe through the bodi to help the bodi contribut to certain . . thing the next major step is that it complet the cycl onli to start over again as anoth mrna leav the nucleu .
13547	5	it begin to go through translat to chang and then head to transcript then move immedi to certain part of the bodi .
13548	5	the sequenc leav the nucleu as mrna . then the messag get chang into trna . then the sequenc move to the mitochondria as trna . then the messag get decod so that the bodi can understand it .
13549	5	the four major step ar interphas metaphas prophas and anaphas .
13550	5	when mrna leav the nucleu it rapidli chang and goe through phase and then protein synthesi is produc .
13551	5	there ar four major step to protein synthesi . first mrna leav the nucleu with inform and take it to the cytoplasm . from there the inform is broken into strand of amino acid . then it is taken to the mitochondria where energi is taken and then it is taken back to the nucleu . then the protein ar made . these four step ar a major part in protein synthesi .
13552	5	four major step in protein synthesi when mrna leav the nucleu is when the mrna goe through the protein and the endoplasm reticulum
13553	5	when mrna leav the nucleu it send the inform to trna trna then transcrib the mrna codon sequenc to a specif locat that will then be us to start protein synthesi onc it is complet it is taken awai and us up .

13916	5	the mrna leav the nucleu to the ribosom to the trna . there trna transcrib it so that the cell know what protein to produc . then the protein is made .
13917	5	collect the inform . replic it . thei transport it and soon us it .
13918	5	the protein synthesi help make protein .
13919	5	. the mrna leav the bodi . . unzip . repeat .
13920	5	. mrna assign job . rrna get the part togeth . trna creat the protein . send the protein to do certain job
13921	5	mrna is instruct for protein synthesi . the trna transport the instruct to the protein . the amino acid ar made or creat . the amino acid ar put togeth to make protein .
13922	5	rna carri messag from dna to specif place in the bodi .
13923	5	prophas metaphas anaphas telophas
13924	5	first the messag ar sent to be deliv second the messag ar retriev third the brain tell the bodi what ha to be done fourth the immun system doe the work
13925	5	the mrna leav the nucleu and begin to replic . after replic it separ from it twin .
13926	5	the mrna ha a code that build protein . it fill these code produc protein until it reach a stop codon . the protein is then taken to other part of the bodi .
13927	5	first mrna leav the nucleu . then it is taken to the amino acid . which then take is to the endoplasm reticulum to read the inform . last is is made into the protein .
13928	5	the mrna head to the ribosom .
13929	5	after the messag get sent the protein then transfer to the dna strand which then get absorb into the strand creat a polypeptid bond .
13930	5	in protein synthesi after the mrna leav the nucleu it enter the cytoplasm . then the trna come in to deliv the code of the amino acid sequenc to the rrna who then take the code to the ribosom to make the protein .
13931	5	the dna get it order to make new protein and the disturb it through out the bodi .
13932	5	when the mrna leav the nucleu that is the first step . the mrna or messeng rna carri instruct to the trna . the transfer rna or trna carri inform for build protein to the amino acid sequenc . then more protein for the bodi ar creat through that sequenc .
13933	5	the messeng mrna leav the nucleu . . .
13934	5	. mrna leav the nucleu carri instruct from the nucleu for the amino acid sequenc of the protein . the mrna wrap itself around a protein . the protein take the inform . the mrna split in two and attach itself to anoth piec of mrna and creat a new strand of dna
13935	5	after the mrna leav the nucleu it carri instruct for the amino acid sequenc of a protein . i can t rememb . i can t rememb . i can t rememb .
13936	5	. the mrna us the inform from the dna to creat codon of the three base . . anticodon ar creat to match the codon . . when codon and anticodon ar match thei make the enzym . . enzym ar us to transcrib protein .
13937	5	it goe to the trna then to the cytoplasm then on a ribosom and come back to the nucleu .
13938	5	the mrna leav the nucleu then travel to it design area . the mrna then deliv the bodi inform that sent it
13939	5	first the mrna find a ribosom and attach to it . second the anticodon with the amino acid attach to it match up to the first codon . third a second anticodon match up and the amino acid from the previou anticodon attach to the other amino acid with a peptid bond . fourth thi goe on until the stop codon is read and the protein is complet .

25482	9	the author first explain what the problem is . then he he show us the histori of space junk and how it came to be . the he sai how space junk can affect our live becaus of incid like the satellit crash into each other . then he sai how peopl do care what is up in space and how thei ar try to get rid of the junk .
25483	9	it start with the start of space explor and tell more and more in each articl until it lead up to the fact that the amount of space trash is still increas and we need to do someth about it .
25484	9	the author organ thi articl by build on what he ha state in the previou paragraph . he also make it more appar in the later paragraph how harm space junk is to the earth s surfac and what kind of problem it pose for astronaut .
25485	9	he she put subtitl to show the differ problem of space junk and what it is and doe .
25486	9	the author organ the articl veri well . at on point he will talk about satellit then he will then talk about microdebri . thi articl ha a lot of inform in it and i have learn a lot . the introduct grab my attent right awai veri enthusiast .

25496	9	the author organ the articl from what happen first and the import . the author want to convinc the reader about the seriou matter of space junk .
25497	9	the author arrang thi articl in a veri organ wai . first he she us an exclamatori attent letter . in the second paragraph the author switch gear and give background inform on how the space junk realli becom junk . next the author talk about a coupl differ exampl of space crash that have occur like the crash between an american commun satellit and a russian on as well . in the end the author talk about how import it is that the space junk is taken care of . he she goe on to explain that the particl in space might be small but thei can still caus signific damag becaus of the speed thei ar move at . the author organ the articl in a wai that can convinc the reader that space junk need to be remov befor more damag is done .
25498	9	the author organ it in a caus and effect sort of wai . he introduc someth call space junk . he explain what space junk is . onc the reader know what space junk is he explain the problem with it . when the reader know the problem he explain that scientist ar search for a simpl solut to space junk .
25499	9	the author organ thi articl start off with a few attent grab sentenc that realli stand out . then the author goe into tell the reader what is space junk he inform us a lot about space craft and telescop and satellit . the author then start tell the reader about crash cours and what to look out for in space while drive a space craft such as the bit of debri . those bit os space debri present a veri seriou problem .

25501	9	the author start the articl with a surpris and attent get statement . then he begin explain the start of space explor and the invent of satellit . mani spacecraft have been sent to outer space over the past year and though thei ar import to the discoveri of what is beyond earth it can be veri danger and develop a problem . the action of send spacecraft into space can caus some spacecraft to collid with other spacecraft . these small fragment of the spacecraft can collid with earth and spacecraft and can caus sever damag despit their size .
25502	9	the art clich orbit junk is organ by introduct fact hook and a conclus . it first give a hook for the reader line of paragraph and in the next section it provid you with inform on he topic at hand which is orbit space junk . then from there on out you ar present with startl statist about space junk which is harm to our bite system in mani wai .
25503	9	he goe from get the reader attent to histori to fact . differ paragraph signifi greater attent in a must factual essai . it is organ in a wai that anyon can be interest and understand space junk .
25504	9	the author start out with exclamatori sentenc . after that the author state all of the import fact about space junk and satellit . then he talk about the collis of object in space that creat a crash cours .
25505	9	he separ the articl into differ paragraph .
25506	9	the author organ the articl in essai style to keep the specif subject separ .
25507	9	the author organ thi articl by someth to grab my attent . then some interest fact the rest wa pretti bore .
25508	9	the author organ thi articl by split up inform into differ group . the author did a good job by organ thi articl into group of orbit junk what is space junk crash cours and littl bit but a big deal . the author could of just put all the inform in the four articl into on big articl but the author wrote headlin support and wrote about her headlin and move on to hi or her next bit of inform .
25509	9	the author start with an attent grab introduct then describ what space junk is then how space junk can be form and final how danger it can be . i know thi becaus in the paragraph after the introduct it tell about all the differ type of thing that can be space deer . then in the paragraph after that it tell about how satellit can crash into each other caus deer or a space man lose hi tool caus deer . final the last paragraph describ how space deer can punch hole in a craft or make it hard for a space ship to maneuv through a deer field .
25510	9	he start off by grab the reader attent with exclam mark . then he get down to seriou busi explain that space junk is a seriou problem . he also explain how the debri can caus satellit collis and how tini particl of debri can be a big deal .
25511	9	the author organ the articl first by introduc it which is a necessari for the reader to understand what the paper will be about he titl section and for the introduc section s titl he put orbit junk to inform the reader of what that specif section will be about . the next section is titl what is space junk he goe into explan of what it is in said section . the section label crash cours explain what happen when no on is control an object . littl bit but a big deal collud the articl and inform the reader of why space junk pose a threat and how the problem is worsen .
25512	9	the author organ the articl in differ section . he first had hi introduct . the articl had a section where he talk about the histori of space explor and what space junk realli is . then in the crash cours section the author wrote about the collis in space that ar caus the debri . final the articl talk about the seriou problem that the littl debri can caus . thi section is inform us to be more awar of the danger it can caus . the author broke thi into section from least import to the most import .
25513	9	i think the author organ thi articl in a wai that the reader get rope into it at the begin with the tone chang part of the wai into it . it show the seriou matter of so call space junk
25514	9	thi articl explain the complic of fly satellit up in space . it goe from inform to
25515	9	the author organ the articl with good and understand tittl that relat to the text that is be talk about and by ad a lot of inform and fact about space junk .
25516	9	the author organ the articl in the best wai i think possibl he make it clear what the import part ar and how import satellit ar . in the introduct the author us dialog to reel the reader in and to make them want to read more . in the section what is space junk he describ in detail what space junk is . in the section littl bit but a big deal he tell the reader how danger space junk can actual be to spacecraft .
25517	9	how the author organ thi articl is by tell us that space junk can be a big problem on space . the need to do mani thing to help the space by not have junk becaus thei want to improv satellit mission . then thei had crash cours it is tell us that with no control that it can risk cold odin ding with on other . than thei tell us it wa big deal thei want us to see that outer space is a veri import place and we need to help it . the articl wa just explain how we need to improv the outer space by do all we need to do .

25519	9	th author organ the articl in variou section . start first with an introduct then onto variou subtop defin space junk space collis and etc . about the main topic orbit junk . it then end with a proper conclus .
25520	9	the author organ hi articl by section . he start out with an intro and tell what space junk realli is . next he goe on to tell about how debri get into space . then he stress the import anc and danger of the space junk
25521	9	with fold titl from differ section of what the author is about to tell us .
25522	9	the author organ the articl three part and name each statement . the intro suction is talk about space junk but we don t know what it is . first on is what is space junk it explain what is space junk and why space junk wa appear . second is crash cours it explain crush about two satellit and how danger it wa . third is littl bit but a big deal it explain small bit about it s danger in the space . and have to find solut .
25523	9	he make it easier for the reader to understand in what order it happen in .
25524	9	the author organ the articl through the us of subsect . thei organ like thing into the same subsect . some subsect that ar us includ what is space junk and crash cours . these subsect allow the author to order the articl in the correct wai . the topic in the articl go from space debri to how space debri come about to the danger of space debri .
25525	9	the author organ thi articl in sort of a chronolog type wai . for exampl the first part of the articl end with space junk the next part begin with what is space junk . then he end the paragraph with disabl object s and begin the next paragraph with dead satellit . when he end a paragraph he end with someth to lead to anoth topic .
25526	9	the author organ the articl veri well . the articl is start off by grab your attent and then reveal some import inform to give you a littl insight on what is to be talk about . the author goe on to speak of the basic histori of spacecraft and what exactli space junk is . thi inform the reader to build up for later inform . fact about collis of satellit ar later discuss which is get deeper into the topic . it is mention that ani object can becom free orbit satellit and transit into how the tiniest object can make the biggest differ . the author sum up the articl with more statist on space junk and inform the reader on the statu of the problem and how it ha been look at .
25527	9	the author introduc the topic . the author let you know what the articl will consist of . then provid a brief histori of the inform . next tell what hi her opinion is and what could possibl happen in the futur . final the author state that someth need to be done to fix the problem .

25532	9	the author goe about get tour attent and then he give you the evid that space junk is danger .
25533	9	the author organ thi articl by hi thought or in the order he think is right . he start off with an introduct then explain space junk the crash cours and final littl bit but a big deal . so therefor he organ thi articl by what he thought would be interest for us reader .
25534	9	the author organ the articl into sub head . each subhead give the reader an idea of what the section is about . for exampl the subhead crash cours prelud the inform abut satellit collid . then within each subhead ar paragraph with the inform .
25535	9	the wai the author organ the articl is by separ the inform into differ section by the inform that wa collect . for exampl the differ inform thei collect wa histori about the first artifici satellit that wa launch crash cours of satellit and the after effect when the launch take place .
25536	9	the articl is organ in section . it ha the introduct the bodi section with titl like what is space junk and then a conclus . the author begin the articl by start off in a not veri seriou tone with hi statement in sentenc and to grab the reader s attent . then he make it much more seriou of a subject . he inform us of the problem that he will be address in later paragraph in paragraph by tell us what space junk actual is . in the section what is space junk the author give us some inform about the histori of space travel and then he tell us the problem of space pollut . in the next section the author tell us about on of the more recent problem with space junk . two satellit collid in mid space in and as a result more space pollut ha occur . in littl bit but a big deal a comparison is made between the space junk and a sandblast to illustr that even though veri small the space junk can be veri harm . in the conclus we learn that the amount of space junk is increas becaus of an increas in commerci space travel and that nation and corpor that take part in space travel in to come togeth to fix the grow problem .
25537	9	he organ it into section or chapter of differ inform of the main topic which is orbit junk .
25538	9	the author organ the articl with an attent get intro . then the articl get seriou on tell us how danger that space junk is . then it tell us how thei can coach into each other in the futur caus problem in space .
25539	9	the author organ hi articl by put them into section . if each section talk about someth differ and goe into detail .
25540	9	the author organ the articl in a veri us wai by titl each section on what it is about .

25543	9	the author organ the arriv in variou section with titl that provid a clue to what the paragraph contain . for exampl the titl crash cours hint that the paragraph is about a crash in space result in space pollut .
25544	9	he first grab your attend chen in the veri begin . he start to describ what space junk . he ha the fact from mani year a go . the author organ hi thought on space junk . he explain how danger it can be . the author ha lot of detail inform on space junk . he want to get it clear that space can be danger for astronaut . the author tell what thei ar do to improv space subtitl and there space suit .
25545	9	it s start off with and attent grab introduct ask us a question follow by a brief histori give us an understand of space junk tell us how it a problem . final stress the danger and extrem of space junk talk about crash and how even small piec can caus larg amount of damag .
25546	9	in the first select it get your attent by us exclamatori sentenc . the second select explain what you find in space . you ar told about what space junk is and how it got there . next in the third select the author tell you about the danger of space junk and give you an exampl of what can happen . the final select summar what ha been talk about in the other select . it also tell you that space junk is a major problem that nasa and other space agenc ar work on .
25547	9	the author organ the articl in the order of event that take place . the author tell about the first satellit capsul and telescop that were launch into space . then the author give all of the inform about space junk . the reader learn what is is and how it collid to make even more . final the author start discuss solut and what scientist ar do to help solv the problem . although scientist ar try there ar veri littl advanc in find a solut .
25548	9	he start of talk about item thei us to see in space . then he start talk about dead satellit . he also talk about the problem their is certain to persist . the amount of space trash increas becaus commerci space travel is on the rise and more nation have undertaken space explor .
25549	9	the author organ the articl by first give person quot and input . the he continu to give fact to support hi point that he is try to make throughout the articl . he split hi paragraph into split topic so he make sure he hit each specif detail .

25552	9	that space agenc hope that the corpor and nation involv can work togeth to come up with a viabl solut to space pollut .
25553	9	the author organ thi articl by order of import .
25554	9	in thi articl the author organ their inform in a wai to help the reader understand . the author start out simpl but then continu to add on inform as the articl goe on . the articl is split up into four differ section . the first is the introduct grasp the reader attent . the second is defin space junk so that the reader understand more with what s to be further explain . the third is explain the problem with satellit crash and space junk crash . lastli the fourth is appli emphasi on how big of a deal thi problem realli is and how it could effect us .
25555	9	well first he give you inform . then the author persuad you of the troubl . then he back up hi inform . after that he tell us what the harm could do to us .
25556	9	he tri to make an interest introduct to grab our attent and make us want to read more of hi articl . then he went on to describ what hi topic wa and about the space junk with detail . hi next topic wa about the crash cours of the space junk and list some crash such as a tool bag escap into the orbit . then to end hi articl he went on describ the space junk and what it can to do to harm space . he conclud with the nation can work togeth to come up with a viabl solut to space pollut .
25557	9	the author give the intro and them stride and explain what make up space junk . then he tell the reason of why it their and reason for it .
25558	9	the author organ thi articl in a logic order . the author start with the introduct move into describ what space junk is explain what happen when satellit collid and eventu tell why all the small debri is veri danger . the author ha these topic list under three main topic what is space junk crash cours and littl bit but a big deal .
25559	9	to make the reader understand how import space junk is and how it can effect the world
25560	9	the author organ the articl in differ paragraph to show differ part of space junk . like in the paragraph what is space junk he talk about what it actual is .
25561	9	the author organ the articl by put some humor in the introduct to make it interest then switch to explain what ha happen in the past . first he tell us what space junk is and explain the how thei can be harm . then he tell us that satellit have crash into each other creat space junk . then in littl bit but a big deal he explain that even the smallest piec of space junk can be serious harm if it come to the earth s surfac .
25562	9	thi author organ the articl in a veri good wai . he start out with a littl quot said by two peopl which is re state in the articl . he then goe to defin what space junk realli is . he tell what it is how it got there and what it doe up there . he then goe into sai how thei run into each other and then state how danger is can be .
25563	9	the author start out with an introduct that grab your attent . then the author goe into the histori of spacecraft satellit then modern dai satellit and then what happen when thei crash . the author is start out in the past and move to the futur with the articl crash cours . the author want you to know that their ar still accid that happen todai even with our technolog and also even in space .
25564	9	the author start off with a veri good attent letter . for exampl when he said grab your telescop look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor it s a . . . . tool bag then the author took a more seriou matter and start to explain the danger of space junk and start throw out lot of fact statist .
25565	9	the author organ the articl by go into detail explain how danger most thing ar in outer space . thei sai in paragraph that in a tool bag escap from the grip of an astronaut do repair on the intern space station . thei sai dead satellit run the risk of collid with each other that is exactli what happen in februari . tini fragment travel at a speed of five mile per second can inflict seriou damag on the most carefulli design spacecraft thei sai that in paragraph .
25566	9	the author begin thi passag by grab the reader attent . although the titl orbit junk is humor the articl is not at all . the titl is a differ wai to grab the attent of the reader . after the introduct and the attent grab the author talk about thing that is veri seriou around our home . next the articl state that two commun satellit on american and on russian both travel at more than mile per hour crash into each other mile abov earth . which would be interest to read if someon didn t know about it . last thei talk about thing that the reader can relat to like a basebal .
25567	9	in categori . . what is junk . crash cours and . littl bit but a big deal
25568	9	at first glanc thi articl seem to have a simpl layout of an introduct and topic . but if you investig further you will see that after the introduct is a topic that follow up on someth mention in the introduct . and as the what is space junk section close with the mention of free float satellit in space it open with a section about these satellit collid . i am veri intrigu by thi wai of organ thought .
25569	9	the author organ it from just thing in space as in debri . also with the crash that happen in between american and the russian .
25570	9	the author begin the articl with a catchi fun introduct and then introduc hi concern about space junk . next in what is space junk the author explain how space junk come to be orbit outer space . in crash cours he bring up the problem of dead satellit collid with each other us an exampl . then he talk about the littl bit of debri creat from these collis in littl bit but a big deal . he explain how these littl piec can caus seriou damag but cannot be detect becaus of their small size . he conclud the articl with the fact that thi problem is go to persist and someth must be done about it .
25571	9	the author organ the articl by us an attent grabber at the begin . he then proce to defin space junk and show how human have creat it over the past year . . . with a brief histori . paragraph the author explain that free float debri case disintegr and creat new smaller space debri . final the author explain that thi microdebri is caus major problem in space explor becaus of the size and the speed at which it travel . the author us a grain of sand travel at mile per second compar to a grain of sand in a gentli breez to show the dramat effect that microdebri can have on a spacecraft satellit or astronaut . the author us an effect organ of get the reader interest inform them briefli of the topic and then to get the reader think about the topic .
25572	9	the author organ it by categori and separ the differ part of the stori .
25573	9	the author start the articl with the definit of space junk . the author write about the histori of space junk and how it ha becom a problem . the author then goe on to talk about how space junk ha now becom a problem becaus mani satellit ar run into each other and becom free float object in space . lastli the author talk about how peopl care about thi grow problem and the wai in which it is try to be fix .
25574	9	the author organ the articl by separ each of hi major point in to section with titl . for exampl the definit of space junk is explain in what is space junk and the problem with space junk is explain in crash cours . littl bit but a big deal explain the graviti of the situat and prove that even the smallest bit of junk is harm let alon huge satellit .
25575	9	the author organ the articl in section . it start out with an introduct which just describ how the space junk can do to our earth . then it goe into three other section that explain what it is what caus it and why it is a huge concern .
25576	9	the author clearli separ thi articl into differ categori that help the reader to better understand the content . for exampl the titl orbit junk explain what the articl is gener about . from the second titl what is space junk we can conclud that the author is go to describ just what space junk actual is . from the third and fourth titl we know that the author is go to tell us on of the main factor that caus debri in space and how much of a threat it actual is . the author separ the articl into small yet detail section so that the reader can better understand the content within it .
25577	9	by put them into section . like space junk to crash cours and littl bit but a big deal . the author put them in order just to show that thei ar a danger thing and that it s not just on littl thing it s huge . the author is try to show and tell you how space junk realli is danger . it is not someth to laugh at our make fun of . if we can t fit our spacecraft through the space junk then there is definit someth wrong . we should not have that kind of problem there shouldn t be anyth but mayb on or to satellit in space so we can have our new . we could have emperor and not know it becaus of all the junk .
25578	9	the author organ the articl by first catch our attent with an introduct then make it seriou by explain what space junk is how it is harm our earth s atmospher .
25579	9	the author organ the articl by make the paragraph flow . first it hook you in with the excit comment like look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor . those varieti of sentenc get you entic into the stori alreadi and make you want to keep read . the next wai thei includ organ is by give inform on the issu of space junk . the titl what is space junk let you know that you ll be learn more in depth about the topic . the third type is us fact and inform to make the stori seem credibl and that the space junk is real . when thei us the statist two commun satellit . . . both travel at more than mile per hour crash into each other mile abov the earth . that at an alarm rate and it make the topic thei ar talk bout seem danger . lastli the author us the strategi of opinion and load languag to show how seriou the issu of space junk is .
25580	9	it start out as fact then turn into a realiz of harm object in space start out as satellit .
25581	9	thi author tell you about on thing and then the next you know it open up for the new paragraph about what els is harm in the space and what ha happen in space and what could be done .
25582	9	the author organ thi articl by separ the main idea into their own section
25583	9	my answer would be about space junk and what it is .
25584	9	by put it a god order . it wa laid out neatli and well organ .
25585	9	first from the begin the author bring up some question to attract reader attent then he start to explain and defin the term of the question and some inform after that he provid some exampl with differ subtitl and also tell us the effect and reason of those exampl final he conclus hi question s answer again from the st paragraph .
25586	9	by tell what to do with trash .
25587	9	he organ each and everi section by how thei ar creat and what went down when the unit state and the soviet union wa in the cold war . the author want us to know how space craft ar us and why thei ar us in planet we call earth todai .
25588	9	the author organ thi articl almost like a new paper . he start with a great introduct about thing that grab the reader attent and motiv to finish thi articl . after that he start the bodi of the arriv and tell the reader about the past of space explor . next the author tell the reader about two satellit collid into each other mile awai from earth . then the author tell the reader about the problem of microdebri and how it can effect futur explor in space . final the author conclud hi arriv and serious tell the reader about the increas problem with space debri .
25589	9	he narrow down about how space junk get into space and how small and pain microdebri can be .
25590	9	at first he come out and make it sound veri interest and try pull the reader in . then he goe into more detail tell you what ar the down fall of the junk in space . he also tell you about how all of the littl bit can make a huge deal . the piec mai be small but can do a lot of damag .
25591	9	from when it start the space travel to up to date explor
25592	9	the author separ the articl into three small section each with their own titl . the author doe thi so if the reader is look for specif inform he can look at the titl to find certain thing . the first sentenc of the entir articl show the author is all about catch the reader attent . the separ of topic into their own titl section is also a wai to catch the reader attent .
25593	9	he start with excit statement . then goe into a seriou tone into space junk to get into the histori of the space race . thi lead into sputnik and the american launch their own satellit . thi goe on for year . then it goe on to mention that all these satellit add to the danger of collis creat debri . thi mention two event on in where an american and a russian satellit collid creat debri and an astronaut loos a tool belt in . thi lead into that even small debri is harm . that even littl grain can damag a spacecraft at great speed . thi add to the danger when launch into space .
25594	9	the author organ the articl by first tell the subject histori then how danger it could be and final how seriou the matter realli is . ex . over the past year a varieti of spacecraft includ space capsul telescop and satellit have been sent beyond the earth s atmospher . ex . with no on at the control dead satellit run the risk of collid with each other . ex . tini fragment travel at the speed of five mile per second can inflict seriou damag on the most carefulli design spacecraft .
25595	9	the author organ thi articl by break it up into differ section . these section ar paragraph that have to do with with on topic .
25596	9	orbit junk startl statement what is space junk statist es crash cours what could happen and what did happen two satellit at more than mile per hour crash into each other littl bit but a big deal peopl opinion what scientist ar go to do about it yet the problem is certain to persist .
25597	9	it is organ by show what the object in space ar and what thei can do to satellit revolv and how thei might be damag do to object not need in the gravit pull of the earth .
25598	9	the author organ the articl in a seri of head and sub paragraph .
25599	9	the author organ thi articl by talk about the danger of space junk and describ the possibl outcom from it . after it talk about space junk it talk about how thing like thi have realli happen . in februari two commun satellit were both travel at mile per hour and crash into each other which creat hundr of piec of debri . that creat hundr of microsatellit fly through space . in the veri last section littl bit but a big deal that talk about how peopl could think that it s not such a huge deal but a lot of peopl actual do .
25600	9	the author organ the articl into three categori what is space junk crash cours and littl bit but a big deal . what is space junk defin what space junk is . crash cours explain how danger space junk can be . littl bit but a big deal explain that mani peopl ar concern about space junk and that it is a big deal .
25601	9	the author organ the articl veri well . in the beg he or she start out with just a few sentenc to grab your attent befor thei start to address the larger matter . then he or she move on to what is space junk and go back in time to explain how space junk becam date all the wai back to dure the soviet union . after tell about space junk over year ago then he or she goe into tell about how danger space junk can realli be . also he or she go into detail toward the end about how even the tiniest junk float around in space can make a tremend disast to a space craft or earth . overal i would have to sai that he or she did and amaz job of organ the right inform and kept the articl flow from on detail to the other .
25602	9	the author us startl statist he highlight the import of satellit he support hi fact and he grasp the reader attent .
25603	9	it is good to know what some of the thing ar befor you read about them so thei ar in a good order .
25604	9	the author put all of hi inform that he want to share into three differ section throughout the stori .
25605	9	it organ it by tell what happen to the unit state spaceship and to the russian s spaceship first . then it tell about all of the debri that float around in space and how it is bad for the space ship that ar up there becaus thei can t see the debri becaus it said thei can t see anyth that is smaller than a basebal .
25606	9	the author tell the articl of how harm littl bit of item in space will effect the world .
25607	9	the author organ the articl into four section . thei begin with an open section that tell the reader what the articl will discuss . then the three other section all have head that give a gener idea about what the few paragraph will be about .
25608	9	the author of thi articl put the section into the import order . he she want peopl to understand what the articl is talk about then explain what space debri is and what the import of it is . the explain what happen when these satellit crash and how danger it can be to the earth .
25609	9	he organ the articl by begin with simpl inform and then give import fact and reason .
25610	9	the author of the articl organ the articl . by first make a hook then some histori behind space explor then thei start with how space collis happen and how thei happen . thei then end the articl with how microdebri is harm to the space craft that ar need to explor the galaxi and commun satellit .
25611	9	the author of the articl orbit junk organ hi inform with fold head . he start in the introduct by get the reader interest . next he educ the reader on what he wa talk about with the head what is space junk . follow thi he us the head crash cours to provid an exampl of an incid . lastli the author conclud with the head littl bit but a big deal to emphas the impact that space junk ha space safeti .
25612	9	what he doe is he will start off a differ topic a differ wai . like for exampl grab your telescop look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor it s a . . . tool bag . then the other time he us a rhetor question a statist and random statement .
25613	9	he organ hi articl by start off by grab the reader attent . thi would intrigu the reader to continu read hi articl . but then right befor the next section thei sai someth that a normal person read the articl would understand . so in the next paragraph thei would talk about it and explain it . thi is what the author doe throughout the whole articl . in the articl it state thi space junk is current of great concern to govern space agenc around the globe . howev someon off the side of the road wouldn t understand what space junk is . so then the author goe into anoth section that is even titl what is space junk thi allow the reader to fulli understand what the author is try to explain to the reader . he organ hi paper so that it doesn t seem to a reader that he is talk in anoth scientif languag that seem difficult to understand . it allow the reader to understand what the problem is .
25614	9	the author organ thi articl by tell the fact from past year to todai societi . from the begin it start out in the then goe to futur date .
25615	9	in the introduct the writer talk about how outer space os fill with clutter and you could basic find anyth . in the bodi he give detail and fact about the unit state and spacecraft and such . in the conclus paragraph the writer explain how thing will never chang and what could possibl happen if thei don t .
25616	9	the author organ the articl by break it down into section . like by the introduct the bodi paragraph and then the conclus instead of just put all that inform into on paragraph . by do that it make it much easier to read and go back somewher that you need to reread or someth .
25617	9	even in outer space pollut is a seriou problem . clutter and debri ar hazard to earth as well as fellow astronaut . space corpor mai probabl need to reconsid the construct of space equip befor launch .
25618	9	well he organ hi articl in to part like tell peopl what to do and sai the observ . then underneath it is the stori what is space junk so he ha him tell direct and then tell a stori .
25619	9	the author start out by us question sort of in a funni wai it s a . . . . tool bag . next thei go on describ the problem what is space junk . then thei describ the caus of it . final thei explain how a littl thing can caus so much damag .
25620	9	the author organ the arriv by put each import fact in a categori all it own . take what is space junk for exampl it explain what space junk is and how danger it cud be to the earth . in the section titl crash cours it talk about the risk of dead satellit collid with on anoth . in februari of commun satellit on american and on russian collid with on anoth .
25621	9	the author organ the articl with head . thei ar what is space junk crash cours and littl bit but a big deal . within each of the head the author also us specif exampl that relat to the head it is under .
25622	9	the author tell you all about the space junk and what ha happen to space in the year s . the author also explain everyth to the reader so thei know that the author is not just plai around thi is a seriou matter and the author want s the reader to understand that . the author help s the reader in a wai so that thei understand how thing s got thi wai in first place which is a good thing becaus it make it easier for the reader to understand where the author is come from .
25623	9	he organ it from small and simpl problem to big and complex conflict .
25624	9	the author organ the inform he gather well . hi introduct paragraph obvious want to catch your attent and to draw hi reader in . secondli he inform hi reader about what exactli space junk is . he taught me what happen to the satellit that stop work and gave me some histori . in the third section crash cours i felt that he still gave me some histori about the satellit . in the last section i felt that he the author scare me a littl bit to help me becom more awar of how danger it is to have float thing in space .
25625	9	thi articl is laid out by topic organ . thi is evid becaus of the fact that there ar four differ label section in the stori each for a differ topic of the subject . for exampl the section titl what is space junk explain what space junk is while the section titl littl bit but a big deal explain why peopl should be worri about space junk .
25626	9	the author organ thi articl by first us a funni and catchi introduct to get the reader s attent and get them interest in the subject . as you read on though the author next us statist and fact and chang the tone from funni to seriou to indic to the reader that even though we might not think about the space debri too much that it pose a seriou threat to human . he us a specif stori to show what he mean about when the two satellit crash into each other . then he goe through explain why the space debri is so danger and why it such a seriou matter . he explain that even though the debri is small that with high speed thei caus a lot of damag . he then describ what we ar try to do to solv and prevent more of the damag from happen but at the end tell us how even though we know it danger the space debri is still increas and that we ar still try to come up with a solut for it .
25627	9	the author separ out differ problem of space debri from what it actual is to how the remain from a crash creat thousand of littl piec and thi number of piec is ever increas . the author talk about how space junk first found it wai in orbit dure the dawn of space explor over year ago how be so far from the earth s atmospher keep them from degrad which make them last longer and therefor make them more like to be in a crash at some point .
25628	9	the author doe a great job of organ thi articl . thei realli set up the inform well . thei tell you about space junk and thei give you a background histori on space explor .
25629	9	the author organ it by ask us question at the begin of the stori give us fact in the introduct . then it goe down to what is space junk it explain that veri well it quot over the past year a varieti of spacecraft includ space capsul telescop and satellit have been sent beyond earth s telescop .
25630	9	in section like the introduct to the littl bit but a big deal
25631	9	realli good .
25632	9	the author put question in the first paragraph and then answer them in complet thought and idea .
25633	9	the author organ hi articl veri well . he made the articl into differ section so if you ar just interest in on subject the you can just read that section . for exampl if you ar just interest in satellit crash then you can just read crash cours .
25634	9	the author organ the articl by first talk about what is space junk then how thei ar danger and what thei do to caus damag . the first part describ what space junk is and how it is form in the atmospher . the second part is describ how it can becom danger when piec break off . the third part is sai how thei have caus damag and how danger thei realli ar . in conclus thi articl is talk about what space junk is and how the govern is concern by it .
25635	9	the author defin what is consid space junk in the first section of the articl . from there the author explain what can happen with the junk that is float around in the orbit . it is explain that the satellit can collid make even smaller debri float in space . thi small debri can caus a spacecraft to malfunct horribl . in the end section of the articl the author state that even the tiniest piec of debri can have a huge impact .
25636	9	the author organ the articl into three main section and an introduct . the introduct ha a titl aptli name orbit junk becaus the charact find a tool bag in space . the second two articl provid inform . the articl titl what is space junk divulg background inform on the subject to the reader . the third section tell what happen to satellit in space and how thei ar a problem . the fourth articl tell what can be and what is be done to prevent and overcom thi problem .
25637	9	the author organ thi articl by put the inform in section . each section talk give differ inform about space junk and space histori . the author divid the inform in three differ categori call what is space junk crash cours littl bit but a big deal .
25638	9	the author organ the articl so that he drag the the reader into the articl .
25639	9	he organ it in tell about the histori and the outcom of the accid .
25640	9	he start the articl with the basic introduct to tell what the articl is about such as orbit pathwai around our planet that were onc clear ar now clutter with remain of numer space explor and satellit mission . then it is sai what caus the space junk and it s from satellit collid in space . then it tell about what the is the big deal with space junk and the danger of it .
25641	9	the articl ar organ by the satellit section and the debri that is caus in space . and the difficulti the debri put on the satellit .
25642	9	the author introduc the articl with give an exampl of space junk . it s a . . . tool bag then the author explain in further detail what exactli space junk is . . . . what happen when a satellit di or malfunct and can t be prepar thi object becom a piec of high tech junk . . . then the author goe on to explain what can happen from the space junk in space . lastli the author tell us how the debri from the collis can lead to veri seriou problem .
25643	9	the author organ the articl by have the gener inform first and then the explan of how the debri can effect the earth how it effect us and why thi issu is around . in the articl the author start out with the gener statement and then clear ivi ani question about the main subject . second the author tell us how the debri got there . lastli the author tell us why it is harm to the planet and us .
25644	9	the author organ the articl by put the differ topic into differ section . he titl on section what is space junk
25645	9	he organ the articl into differ section so that you can find what your look for easier .
25646	9	the author organ thi articl by us subhead . he us the subhead what is space junk crash cours and littl bit but a big deal . the subhead make it easier for the reader to find the inform thei ar look for . under the subhead what is space junk on might find the definit of space junk . . . . what happen when a satellit di . . . the disabl object becom a piec of high th junk cycl the globe in uncontrol orbit . thi explain what space junk is and how it becom space junk . the subhead crash cours might emphas what will happen if the space junk s orbit cross . two commun satellit . . . crate into each other . . . now instead of two disabl satellit there ar hundr of microsatellit fly through space . thi explain what happen when the path of disabl satellit cross . the subhead littl bit but a big deal might discuss hoe the microdebri can have a harm effect . . . . the amount of space trash is actual increas . . .
25647	9	the author organ hi articl in a veri peculiar wai . it first start with a great attent letter show what space junk is . then he talk about the histori of the junk why it is there . next he describ the crash that can occur due to space junk . he end with what space junk is do and how harm it realli is .
25648	9	the author organ hi idea by put them into titl paragraph . each subject doe not flow so well togeth so he put them separ to emphas each paragraph .
25649	9	that there is space junk all over the space and it could hurt the earth and the space center in space .
25650	9	the author organ the the articl veri well in my opinion . the author tell what goe on in space and all kind of detail about it .
25651	9	with new caption befor everi parad .
25652	9	the author organ the articl by fact . he wrote hi sub titl and put down the inform need to explain the head .
25653	9	the author organ the articl by the most import to the least import . he start off with the biggest problem space junk and end with littl bit but a big deal . he tell how the littl bit of space debri is a seriou problem but space junk is a much bigger problem .
25654	9	the author tell what is space junk he also give more inform about the satellit . he also mean chess about the crash cours . in paragraph six branch that when no on is at the control the dead satellit run the risk of collid with each other . the other detail inform wa in paragraph eight littl bit but a big deal . that s talk about how it is a problem to the space program . like in paragraph eleven sai in fact the amount of space trash is actual increas becaus commerci space travel is on the rise and more nation have undertaken space explor . in paragraph it also mean chen how the littl thing in space can be difficult for space craft .
25655	9	he doe it veri well .
25656	9	the author explain differ in mani paragraph how space junk can be a hazard to the atmospher .
25657	9	he organ it by explain the danger held within space trash . in the first two articl he explain what space trash is and identifi that it is a huge problem .
25658	9	the author organ the articl into well defin titl section each describ the titl in detail . on of the section call crash cours is a two paragraph section on how satellit becom debri . first a paragraph on larg satellit that collid to creat tini microsatellit . the next a paragraph on less spectacular crash . how astronaut mai accident lose someth in the great vacuum of space .
25659	9	the author start hi stori with a an ctodatol lead then the author talk about a problem . explain why thi problem occur . final tell what will happen in the futur why it harm the earth and how thi might effect us by sai that more sat light will hit each other and our orbit around earth will be cluster in the near futur .
25660	9	he organ the articl by us pacif titl for each paragraph he write and includ inform that is regiment to the titl in each section of the titl .
25661	9	the author organ the arriv by tell what is in outer space and what can and ha happen in outer space . the author describ the danger and tell how it could hurt the earth .
25662	9	the articl ha an introduct some background and histori of space junk then it talk about the problem of space junk and how it collid with each other the it end with the big problem and how it should and could be fix .
25663	9	the author organ thi articl into mini chapter . the chapter cover main topic that the author talk about most . the first chapter is call what is space junk . the author then support thi rhetor question with two paragraph . the second paragraph titl crash cours is also support by two paragraph . the last paragraph littl bit but a big deal is support by three paragraph .
25664	9	the author organ the articl by first get you hook . thei catch your attent . then the author introduc what the articl is realli about . next it explain space travel and us detail to support the argument that thi is a problem .
25665	9	the author organ hi articl base on the sever of the matter . first he start out explain what exactli space junk is . then he move on to hint at the possibl of debri crash into import space object such as satellit . he final put more emphasi on the subject by share truth that have happen in the past and what could becom of these fly invis basebal .
25666	9	the author start out by talk about how odd it is to see a tool bag in space just float around . then the author goe into explain what space junk is . the author give exampl of what would be consid space junk . then the author ha a paragraph titl crash cours . thi paragraph is talk about how the satellit that ar sent out into space ar not control by anybodi . thei ar just out there . the author also talk about how when the satellit crash into each other how big of a deal that is . the satellit crash into each other creat space junk . the author also ha a paragraph titl littl bit but a big deal . thi paragraph is talk about how peopl think that littl space debri isnt as big of a deal as peopl make it out to be . the author give an exampl of throw sand at someth or shoot it through a sandblast and the differ in impact . thi paragraph is pretti much tell you that it doesn t matter how big or small the debri is it can still do a lot of damag .
25667	9	the author organ thi articl by what it about to what is it that can it do .
25668	9	he put the differ topic that peopl mai want to know about in differ section of the stori . like separ the inform about satellit from space junk .
25669	9	the author organ the articl in a wai that show how satellit get to where thei ar then what happen if thei were to get disabl and collid and final the potenti danger it creat .
25670	9	he organ the articl by put titl at the begin of a new section and that tell the reader that someth els is about to happen . the subject is about to chang and the author doe thi by have titl . you do not see thi veri often you usual just see an indent to start a new paragraph and a new idea . he start it off realli good and that draw the reader in and then he begin with all the fact and everyth about space junk .
25671	9	he us sub titl to organ the articl .
25672	9	he break it down into categori of each specif branch of inform
25673	9	he put the inform in order .
25674	9	the author start off with an introduct from the reader point of view then the author give a littl inform about space junk and what it made from . the the author talk about why there is space junk . the last paragraph talk about why space junk is danger and all the effect it could have .
25675	9	the author organ the articl by us thing that the reader might actual interest a person .
25676	9	the author first ha the introduct and hi attent grabber it s a . . . tool bag . the next three section what is space junk crash cours and littl bit but a big deal ar all separ and organ by categori of inform . for exampl the section what is space junk give a background histori of space junk but the section crash cours is all about satellit crash into on anoth .
25677	9	the author organ the articl by first grab your attent and then give you fact .
25678	9	he explain it in detail from begin to the end
25679	9	the author organ the articl by have a introduct and a middl and an end .
25680	9	the author organ the articl by differ topic . the first paragraph is about a comet but it realli wasn t on it wa just a tool bag . the next on wa about what is space junk . then the second to last topic wa about that stuff we leav in space will come down and have a crash cours toward earth . the last topic is littl but but big deal someth small from space can fall to earth and still leav a veri big impact on earth .
25681	9	the author organ the articl in differ section . in the first part of the articl the author explain what space junk is . in the second part the author explain how the space junk got there . in the last part of the articl the author explain how the space junk is a problem and is danger .
25682	9	by creat smaller section of the read with catchi titl the author make the passag more direct on certain subject . that also allow the author to talk about sever differ topic throughout the passag . engag the reader and keep them engag is sometim a problem and with the differ interest titl the reader is constantli re engag .
25683	9	the author organ in a wai that build up on the topic . first the author talk about what is space junk and when it start . second the author give inform on when the space junk actual becam a problem in the crash of two satellit . last the author explain that littl thing can have a big impact .
25684	9	the author had support toward the fact becaus he had been to the space ship and flew to the moon and experienc the moon .
25685	9	he come in week but finish strong
25686	9	think the author organ the articl in order of import . i think he did thi to build up to to show that littl bit in space ar often over look but thei ar so import as ani other thing .
25687	9	the author organ the inform by start with the main titl and then follow by subtitl to divid the inform into differ categori .
25688	9	he begin by explain space junk and the histori of it . then he explain how danger all of the microdebri can be consid there is veri much of it around space . crash happen often . final he explain how much peopl care about the debri and how it not just an ignor problem . it can caus seriou damag .
25689	9	the author organ the articl in chronolog order . thei start each paragraph with a question and then thei answer it in a well thought out paragraph put thing in an order that can be easili understood by the reader .
25690	9	he start the articl off by get the reader s attent with a real scenario . after he ha the reader s attent he chang the tone of the articl to more a seriou mood . he doe thi to emphas the import of the space junk . he first explain what space junk is then explain the harm it can caus then explain that even though it s small it is a seriou matter .
25691	9	the author organ the articl by divid it into section . first section is about orbit junk . second is what is space junk . the third is about the crash cours . at but not least is the littl bit but a big deal .
25692	9	the author first grab your attent with the interest introduct . he then continu on to talk about satellit collis to explain why some space junk exist . then he share some import fact about space debri and make it evid that it is a seriou matter .
25693	9	the author organ the articl by first explain what space junk is . then the author goe on to tell us that crash have happen and then explain what a threat the space junk can be .
25694	9	the author organ the articl by assign the inform to it own section and give the inform a titl . for exampl the titl what is space junk give inform about all of the differ junk we send up into space explain how it come back to earth and why thi is so on need .
25695	9	in paragraph form with more than on head .
25696	9	i person think that it is a good articl . the author ha done a veri good job . with us the histori of nasa and other . anoth thing i realli like about it . is there is a titl for each new paragraph . to help the reader stai clear of confus . and mush togeth paragraph . i also like the open introduct to thi littl stori .
25697	9	first the author will give you inform about why satellit went into space . then he will will lead into tell you how uncontrol satellit ar more like to run into each other and when thei do a lot of deer is let out in space . after that he explain how when astronaut go into space thei should be super care so thei do not let ani more deer go into space becaus is it not need . later he goe into how more space junk is actual increas and he hope corpor work togeth to help stop thi .
25698	9	first he start out with a small question to draw you in . then he give you fact about space junk and sai how to fix it .
25699	9	the author begin with an excit hook that make you want to read more . grab your telescop . . . then he add a sens of humor when he sai it s a tool bag then after hi introduct he describ what space junk realli is . then he record the danger of have space junk or for exampl dead satellit float around in space . thei ar at risk of collid with each other . he explain how after the crash instead of sat titl roam around there wa now hundr of piec of debri fly through space . to us we mai not see the harm in littl bit fly around but he goe on to inform us on how it is a big deal . conclud with space trash be a seriou issu .
25700	9	he give titl for all section of the articl that us reader can follow most ear than a big summari of the orbit junk in ar space .
25701	9	the author titl each new section . there ar four section all togeth includ the introduct there ar what is space junk crash cours and littl bit but a big deal .
25702	9	the author organ the passag with three main topic in addit to the introduct . the author defin space junk give specif exampl of it and express potenti danger it could bring . a specif exampl occur in when two fast move satellit collid forc hundr of microdebri piec into the gravit pull of earth .
25703	9	the author organ the articl by brake it down into small section that to togeth help you fulli understand the articl .
25704	9	the author organ the articl orbit junk in a specif wai . the author begin by grab the reader s attent with line such as grab your telescop look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor it s a . . . tool bag the articl goe on to describ what space junk actual is and the outcom it ha on planet earth . deeper in the articl a reader can find exampl of satellit crash in the segment titl crash cours . the author give an exampl of when two commun satellit crash into each other in februari of . the author close the articl by describ that even the smallest of debri can make a differ in the solar system .
25705	9	the author organ the articl horribl
25706	9	the author organ the articl with
25707	9	he start by show some histori of space lanc into space . then he talk about that over time that satellit becom junk that can make problem in space for satellit that ar still good . and that we need to start beef more care about we do down in earth .
25708	9	the author organ it by tell exactli what it is at the begin by have on of the section name what is space junk then tell some issu about what damag space junk can caus in the section titl crash cours . tell how all that junk got into outer space in the first place . then the author finish off with the section littl bit but a big deal . thi section talk about who care about space junk and how to prevent it .
25709	9	start with an introduct that explain person statement . then to explain what the term space junk actual mean . from statist to mani interest fact it explain how it get there what happen to it and how bad it is effect space .
25710	9	the author start with an introductori and then us titl for differ subject the author is talk about . the author doe thi to better organ the articl . separ into differ stori is easier and let the reader understand what she is write about befor thei read it .
25711	9	the author organ the articl by give an earli histori of the first satellit up to more of the modern dai on . in the last paragraph it talk about space debri .
25712	9	the author organ the articl by put differ articl on differ page and the layout ha to be put a certain wai and thing have to be perfect . there cannot be ani error spell mistak typo noth like that . the paper is onli allow to be so mani page so there can t be ani articl too long or there can t be too mani .
25713	9	explain the histori of space junk .
25714	9	the author organ the articl by first describ what sac junk is then go on to tell you about how it can be danger .
25715	9	the author arrang it by import . such as draw the reader in with exclam mark and excit phrase then move on to more seriou explain .
25716	9	the author start out the articl by try to grab your attent and make the articl seem appeal to the reader . he doe thi by sai grab your telescop look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor it s a . . . . tool bag thi quot doe do the job of grab the reader s attent becaus it s a veri common catch phrase that he us . next the author describ just exactli what space junk is by give the histori of space explor within the human race . the paragraph is titl what is space junk he state how exactli the satellit and other object becaus thi junk the object themselv howev ar posit hundr of mile abov the earth far from element that would caus them to degrad or burn up . in thi airless environ some of them continu to circl the planet indefinit . thi paragraph also explain that when a piec of high tech junk is disabl that it just orbit around the earth uncontrol . within the next two paragraph the author give differ fact as to how the space junk is harm two commun satellit on american and on russian both travel at more than mile per hour crash into each other mile abov the part . the impact creat hundr of piec of debri each assum it own orbit path . it goe on with describ the differ danger that these path of debri caus .
25717	9	i think that the author organ the articl in order from most import to least import . te author us a lot of detail in the begin but not as mani in the end . but the author definit us a lot of detail through the whole articl .
25718	9	the author is build up on the import as the articl goe on . start with just sai there is space junk and end with there is a lot of it and we can not see what is smaller than a base ball .
25719	9	the arriv is start with tell us what space junk is . then the arriv is run the through the histori . final it get into the size and defin of it .
25720	9	the orbit pathwai around our planet that were onc clear ar now clutter with the remain of numer space explor and satellit mission .
25721	9	the author organ thi articl by split it into differ section . the section includ orbit junk what is space junk crash cours and littl bit but a big deal . the author split hi articl into these four section to make hi articl organ so the reader can quickli find what thei need to read .
25722	9	the author organ the articl into section that have differ purpos .
25723	9	the author organ the articl by tell what the reader realli don t know much about . like what space junk is and how doe it effect thing in space . then it lead into how satellit realli work
25724	9	he like to split it up into section topic . then the author just goe on and on with hi stori .
25725	9	he organ it in a section form . he take all the inform that is relat to each other and split it up into similar group
25726	9	the author organ thi by give you exampl and descript on the realiti of space . how just littl piec of space junk can jepid a mission toward space .
25727	9	the author tell how space junk is a big deal . then start with how it get to becom space junk . then the author talk of how we have to detect it and try to avoid it and what problem occur becaus of it .
25728	9	thi articl is divid up into smaller section to make it easier to read . each section ha a titl such as crash cours to let the reader know what inform will be present in that section . there ar so mani differ topic about space junk that the author cover in thi articl such as how space junk got into space and how it can caus problem for spaceship that break it up with the interest titl wa good organ by the author .
25729	9	he start with a strong introduct that grab the reader attent . he then begin to discuss differ import fact about space . he tell the thing that go on in space and the problem that occur . he also speak on the opinion of peopl and how thei actual care about space debri with it be a seri problem . last he tell about the scientist and how space agenc ar work togeth to come up with a wai to basic stop space pollut . the author organ thi articl veri well becaus it flow nice and give great detail .
25730	9	the author begin with an introduct to grab the attent of the reader us startl statement and an interest rhetor question . he then switch the tone of the articl to more seriou and inform . he categor inform into three categori what is space junk crash cours and littl bit but a big deal . the first categori tell the reader about how space junk is form and what it consist of . furthermor the second categori delv further into the topic of the magnitud of crash between satellit orbit the earth . addition the third categori inform the reader about why tini particl in space orbit the earth ar veri danger . in sum the author organ the articl in thi fashion to help the reader understand the detriment to space junk .
25731	9	the author organ the articl into individu titl section which each address a veri specif aspect of space junk or further explain the issu it creat in the atmospher . after the introduct three section section follow each of which consist of two to four paragraph . what is space junk explain the concept of debri orbit the earth in space and how it came to be . crash cours begin to explor the danger of such debri . lastli littl bit but a big deal emphasi es the serious of the issu of space junk .
25732	9	first the author explain to the reader what space junk is . then the exampl of the american and russian satellit crash is present to show how the crash creat debri . final the author goe into detail about how the space junk is veri danger and how mani organ ar search for a solut to the problem .
25733	9	the author organ the articl by introduc the topic explain it import and an provid support detail . the passag inform the reader about space debri . then the author continu to give inform about it danger . final thei give exampl of what variou size and type of debri can damag or destroi . it also inform the reader of difficulti it can caus .
25734	9	the author draw you in with the introduct then explain what space junk is and how it ha becom a problem . the author also explain how space junk end up in orbit in the first place . then the author explain how dead satellit creat even more space junk after thei collid with anoth satellit or ani other space junk freeli orbit the earth . lastli the author explain how danger thi space junk can realli be and all the damag it could caus .
25735	9	the author went from small problem to big problem that he more effect on us . the author start out with describ the what thing were in space to what thei could do while thei ar up there .
25736	9	the articl ha a catchi introduct . it ask excit question to get the attent of the reader . after the open the writer goe directli into the bodi of the paragraph begin with fact definit explan and detail such as space junk what it caus size and simil compar microdebri to sandblast . toward the end the writer explain how litter in space can caus great problem to orbit spacecraft . the writer explain thi by sai that littl bit ar a big deal .
25737	9	the author organ the articl becaus mani peopl do . also so he did it becaus certain to persist can be a problem . space agenc hope that the corpor and nation involv can work togeth to come up with a viabl solut to space pollut
25738	9	the author organ the articl by make the introduct interest then the import inform about space . us newer inform and also us some space histori which make it more interest know what space wa like year ago and how it could be differ now .
25739	9	the author organ it in wai with differ kinda stuff on everi on
25740	9	the the author organ the arriv by sub topic . everi sub topic ha it own titl such as crash cours or littl bit but a big deal .
25741	9	the author organ it in a special wai . he grab your attent by put exclam point in . then he ask question and give some fact . he state the problem and also give more fact and exampl .
25742	9	the author organ the articl by first get the reader attent then tell what the articl is about then tell about it .
25743	9	the author organ the articl in a understand wai . for exampl if some doesn t know the mean of what he is talk about then it will be much easier for the reader to understand hi point . he introduc by be show so that the reader would get interest on the articl . he then continu with what hi point mean follow by fact that have happen in space . that wai is understand and the reader do not get confus .
25744	9	the author organ the articl by defin the term space junk give exampl of seriou situat that caus the junk and last the author explain the consequ of the amount of trash in space . accord to the articl the amount of space trash is actual increas becaus commerci space travel is on the rise and more nation have undertaken space explor .
25745	9	the author start by draw in the reader in hi introduct . he then give a histori on what space junk is and how it got there . after that he give exampl of how two differ instanc where space junk ha been put out into space . he then us hi given inform to sum up in the end of how space junk is effect us and to emphas that it is a big deal .
25746	9	the author start out by try to get us realli interest in the articl with excit statement from peopl . then he goe on about the confus part of the tool bag and how peopl dont understand it be there . after that he goe into detail about her space junk is bad and how we should take extrem precaut to space junk and that it can be danger . next he tell us some of the accid that have happen to space object from space junk to help us get a better understand on how bad space junk can be . last but not least he tell us how space junk is increas becaus of the commerci space trivial and how we ar do more of it . he end it by sai that we ar just increas save pollut .
25747	9	the author organ thi articl into section . each section ha a differ subject . the paragraph ar orbit junk what is space junk crash cours and littl bit but a big deal . these ar wai to explain the differ subject .
25748	9	the author start out with an introduct and a definit of what space junk is . the author then tell us of wai that space junk is creat and then finish by talk about the effect and possibl problem of the futur .
25749	9	the author start out in the begin tell you how all of the space debri start to becom what it is . the author then tell you how all of thi pose a threat to everyth that leav earth atmospher to go to anoth planet or to just work on a satellit .
25750	9	the author start out by have a topic paragraph to interest the reader . then he explain that mani spacecraft have been sent beyond earth s atmospher . in crash cours he explain that spacecraft can crash into each other and debri fly around . he then explain that even if the debri is small it s still danger .
25751	9	the author organ the articl by describ the process in which space junk can be harm .
25752	9	the author organ hi thought veri well . he ha and introduct that get the reader interest grab your telescop look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor not onli doe thi start off get you interest but it also end with a sort of puzzl statement . it s a . . . tool bag the he move on to what is space junk here he move onto describ and defin what space junk is and how it can be deadli .
25753	9	he organ it by spread the differ topic . first he wa talk about orbit junk then he wa talk about like what is space junk and other stuff like that .
25754	9	the author organ the articl in the best wai that he can to inform you about space junk . he start off with what is space junk which tell you all about it and what it is . then he tell you about what happen when thei crash into thing and how big of a deal it all realli is .
25755	9	the author organ thi articl in section . each section ha it own stori and import inform . thei ar separ into section becaus not all of them flow togeth . each on emphas it own import .
25756	9	he tell what is space junk how it can get into space and that no matter the size ani thing that is float around out there is harm .
25757	9	an attent grab begin follow by explain what space junk is then sai that old satellit run the risk of crash into each other and debri hit the earth follow by the danger of micro debri .
25758	9	the author organ the articl by split it up into four section that each have a differ focu . the first section is the introduct which state the topic and express the import of the subject . thi is proven when the articl state that thi space junk is current of great concern to govern space agenc around the globe . the follow section what is space junk proce to explain exactli what space junk is and how it is creat when it state that disabl object commonli from dead satellit circl the globe in an uncontrol orbit . the third section crash cours focus on the danger of dead satellit crash into each other . the section state that after a satellit crash instead of two dead satellit orbit in space there ar hundr of microsatellit which can be much more danger . the last section littl bit but a big deal restat the danger of debri fly around in space and emphasi es the situat thei can caus . the section state that at extrem speed littl bit can pack a punch power enough to creat disastr hole in an object move through space . the author separ the articl into section to help the reader understand certain aspect of space junk in a more organ manner .
25759	9	space pollut can chang and hurt the planet
25760	9	in thi articl the author us a hook in the introduct to get the reader involv in the stori and want to read more . the author then chang the tone and express the serious of the topic . thei begin to give background on what ha happen in the past and how much damag it ha done . the author is try to give the reader inform on how big of a deal thei feel space junk is to our orbit pathwai .
25761	9	the author organ thi articl by start with a introduct . then the author goe on to explain the histori of space junk and how it began . the author then goe on to explain the impact space debri doe to other satellit along with some statist inform about space junk . the author finish the articl with a conclus
25762	9	he explain about the object in space the junk that is found in there and then he goe on tell about how the object got to space and in what wai thei have affect earth . he tri to tell thing that caus thi nd then he tell of how thei ar go to affect us and how thei have increas .
25763	9	the author start with some statement to get the reader interest then goe into when the first natali wa shot into space . the author then talk about what happen to satellit that di and were free orbit the danger that could happen when satellit began to crash into each other . then the author end with explain the after effect of a crash and the harm it doe .
25764	9	first he come off with humor to get you interest . then hit you with the seriou stuff . he then he tell what space junk is . then final tell you about the crash problem and why it is so import to care .
25765	9	the author catch the attent of the reader by make a statement of someth that is in realist when sai there is a tool bag in the sky . then it goe on to tell what space junk is or the stuff that float around in our orbit that we can still see . after explain that is tell of how the debri get there and how it is harm to further studi of outer space or even the astronaut there to studi it . the articl is all put into place to tell the reader of how a small matter ha turn into a veri big problem for astrolog .
25766	9	the author organ the articl by differ paragraph and titl . the introduct set up the scene and present the problem . the first section what is space junk help the reader understand all of the debri that pollut our atmospher . the second section crash cours tell the reader about the crash and collis that happen in space . and final the littl bit but a big deal section present how we have tri to fix the microdebri problem in space .
25767	9	the author organ the articl by dive it into section with head . each head ha inform under it that correspond to the head .
25768	9	first the author grab the reader attent with the open paragraph . then thei go on to tell the reader about what space junk is . next thei talk about how satellit and other thing in space crash into each other . last thei explain how just the simpl small thing that float in space ar harm .
25769	9	the author organ thi articl with differ head for differ inform . these head preview the inform to follow . these differ head explor mani kei item in explain the space junk problem .
25770	9	ha like excit comment in the begin . then through out the middl get seriou and tell the import of what he is talk about . he also give exampl and mani detail . then wrap it up by sai that someth need to happen for it will get wors .

25777	9	the author separ hi articl into differ section and give them differ titl . like first he start off with an introduct that is an attent letter line grab your telescop look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor line it s a . . . tool bag reader would be confus and shock on why there is a tool bag float in space becaus it unusu .
25778	9	the author first introduc the topic by show that space junk can sometim be mistaken for comet or meteor . next he or she explain what space junk is and how it got into space . follow next is the explan that if too much space junk is up in space satellit will collid with each other like two did in februari of . he or she then make a further explan between the tini space particl and speed sai if the space junk wa tini particl of sand blow in a gentl breez thei would not be danger . howev when be blown from a sandblast to take paint off of a concret wall the space junk particl becom extrem danger . the author then explain that space agenc ar strive to make new develop in space travel safer by build extra wall on space ship and make thicker space suit to try to reduc the impact of the particl . the author then finish it up sai space agenc ar work togeth to try to find a solut for space pollut .
25779	9	the author organ thi articl by break it up into it onli littl section like orbit junk what is space junk crash cours littl bit but a big deal .
25780	9	he start off by catch the reader attent then goe into histori next fact and then what need to be done and what can happen with space junk in the conclus .
25781	9	the author start out by state that you can observ space junk and it isn t as strang as it seem . the author goe on to explain what space junk is and how it got there . then explain that when the technolog goe dead the risk of the satellit crash into anoth and then the piec crash on earth becom higher . he goe on to explain that these littl piec of space junk even if thei down crash into earth thei ar still a threat to astronaut who ar on space mission .
25782	9	he doe so by make vital of section and then go in detail on such topic list in the arriv .
25783	9	the space junk on is talk about the thing that happen and or that can happen and stuff of spacecraft and about the earth and stuff . the crash cours is talk about the danger and that sort of stuff .
25784	9	the author organ the articl by tell us the main idea in order from least import to most .
25785	9	talk about the space junk and the soviet union launch the first artifici satellit . then the crash cours and talk about the crash . the littl bit but a big deal and talk about how space ha trash float around .
25786	9	the author open with a interject to help grab the reader s attent . he then shift into histor fact and analysi to show the danger of space junk . the author proce to tell about the effect that space junk can have on spaceship and satellit and the risk that thei can put on them . thi help show how space junk is a seriou matter that can make or break a space explor mission .
25787	9	the author start the articl with state that space junk is common in space he then answer the question on what exactli is space junk with detail . he then explain the danger of space junk and how to fix the grow problem .
25788	9	first he us some shock statement to draw the reader in . then elabor on some term given in the introduct and give exampl of them . explain the danger of them tell how the space junk can be form such as a tool box slip out of a astronaut hand or two commun satellit travel at mile per hour collid with each other . he end with explain why all the littl piec ar import and especi the larger piec .
25789	9	he organ it by write the space event in order and tell about them in alphabet order .
25790	9	the author organ the articl by present in the introduct that space junk is a concern . after the introduct the author explain to the reader what space junk is . then the author tell about instanc where two satellit collid and how a tool bag escap an astronaut in space . after that the author explain the problem that debri in space can make and that space agenc hope corpor and nation can work togeth to come up with a solut to collid debri in space .
25791	9	in the first part of the articl the author describ what space junk is . then he explain what the problem ar with space junk just float around in the air . then he gave exampl of what could happen with all of the space junk in the air .
25792	9	the author start off the passag get your attent by relat it back to your life . than the author talk about a time frame . than the author talk about how space debri can be danger . final the passag sai why we should be care around these debri fragment becaus thei can serious harm the rocket we launch .
25793	9	the author us the introduct to hook you in to read the essai than us startl fact about space junk and than talk about differ item that ar space junk .
25794	9	in the articl he show how the stuff in space can be veri harm to spacecraft in the sky . it could hurt someon or even kill them from the fall of the spacecraft .
25795	9	the author tell about how bad thing can happen up in space . he goe from the worst to not as bad . just like the two satellit collid .
25796	9	the author organ thi veri well . he us an introductori section three main point and a conclus . i veri much like hi introductori section it realli draw you in .
25797	9	at first the author identifi the subject . then provid some histori about the subject . next the author talk about how trash in space get to small piec and how it affect space explor . lastli the author state problem that have been caus and problem that ar still and will be caus if space explor ar continu also mayb how to stop it and keep debri under control .
25798	9	the author organ the articl by break each topic down in section .
25799	9	i think the author is well organ is thi articl . the author start talk about what space junk is and how import satellit ar . then the author goe into greater detail and import with the satellit issu . the author then tell us how satellit crash and how much damag it is to the earth s atmospher . then the author finish off with how the microdebri is harm our atmospher greatli .
25800	9	the author start the articl with some interest rhetor question to get the reader s attent . he then talk chang the mood of the articl of a more seriou sens so becaus the matter can caus damag . he talk about some differ thing in space and provid multipl fact . he end with talk about how the space pollut can pose a seriou problem .
25801	9	thei start off with an attent grab begin . grab your telescop look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor it s a . . . tool bag then thei get all seriou and go into what is space junk then crash cours and littl bit but a big deal .
25802	9	the author start out with a good attent letter . then give a littl inform of the background about the topic . from there the author state problem caus by all the space debri .
25803	9	first he explain what space junk is then how it is harm .
25804	9	the author organ the articl by first grab the reader s attent explain the topic give more specif detail and then state the effect of space debri . the author attract the reader by state that instead of find a meteor or comet in the sky on mai see a too bag . in the next paragraph there ar detail list what space junk is . next the author tell of the histori of space junk . lastli the author emphas that space junk can be undetect harm to other space devic and that space debri is pollut .
25805	9	author organ the articl into subsect that cover an area of import to the articl . the first articl what is space junk talk about how object themselv howev posit hundr of mile abov earth . the second articl is name crash cours and it talk how dead satellit run the risk of collid with each other and crash that creat debri . the final section littl bit but a big deal talk about space debri present a veri seriou problem . what all thi mean is that it organ to deal with separ thing that go on in space and how thing get there and how it ha an effect of other space trip . that is how the articl is organ .
25806	9	first off the author make it sound like it s realli excit so that it make you want to read the stori . then talk about what is space junk and went on from that . told us a littl bit about everyth peopl call space junk . like the space capsul telescop and satellit .
25807	9	he organ the articl in by pollut and the histori of the stori of space the last frontier . he teach about everyth that you need to know for space .
25808	9	what is space junk crash cours littl bit but a big deal .
25809	9	the author organ thi articl by list everyth in order . thei list the event in chronolog order . thei tell you what happen first then tell you the danger that effect it .
25810	9	the author organ the articl veri well . it is four differ section about import thing with space . the articl ha a lot of good inform and fact .
25811	9	mani subsect break down the articl to a smaller more manag size and give an easi wai for the reader to find specif inform
25812	9	he first start off with a hook to catch the reader s attent and then he start state fact and event of satellit that soon becam space junk over a period of time . he also give a stori of what happen when a toolbag wa lost in space and how danger that could be . he finish with state that there should be a solut for space pollut .
25813	9	the author organ the articl by put stuff into differ categori of stuff everyth the author talk about ha a categori that it fit best into and thei talk about it like thei talk about crash cours and all it talk about is satellit crash into on anoth and deer
25814	9	support hi or her introduct with fact and statement . the author bring histori into it and let s us know what ha happen and how danger it is and how harm it is .
25815	9	thei start it off with someth that will get your attent with a popular quot that we have al heard . then thei give you a basic definit and histori about it and tell you how it start and which countri did . then thei explain how it is made or creat by tell us that two dead satellit collid and made mani mani piec that ar still there todai . . then in the final section thei explain that thi is a veri seriou matter and is not to be taken lightli .
25816	9	the author organ the articl by name the differ topic that he want to talk about . he tell you about everyth that is happen in space . how the trash in space is a bad thing and is not ok .
25817	9	he start off the articl by ad suspens . then drop to a more calm wai . eventu lead to the explan of space junk .
25818	9	the author organ the arriv by first make a veri interest introduct . then by describ what space junk actual is and how we have had a varieti of space junk for over year . in the third paragraph crash cours talk to us about how satellit in space and other object can crash into each other and complet destroi each other . last but not least littl bit but a big deal tell us about the danger of what can happen when two object collid in space .
25819	9	the author organ the articl into multipl section with their own headlin that tell what the write is go to be about . for exampl the section crash cours explain how there have been mani crash due to the debri float around in space . the wai the author organ the articl is help to the reader . for exampl if the reader just want to know what space junk actual is thei can skim the headlin and find someth that deal with space junk or if thei just want to be inform about what danger space junk caus thei can just read the section littl bit but a big deal .
25820	9	the author start with an introduct and then begin to provid the reader with background inform . then the author provid an exampl of the problem and follow it up with a conclus that summar hi point .
25821	9	the author put it in to part and talk about the import idea of the station in with the articl is about . for an exampl if the titl wa satellit it would be talk about satellit .
25822	9	the author titl each section with a new name . like what is space junk thi section give a littl histori of space travel and the debri it is caus . then crash cours tell about differ satellit crash and creat more debri in space . final there is littl bit but a big deal which is us to make the reader realiz even though the debri can be veri small it can caus a lot of damag .
25823	9	the author organ the articl by put interest inform in the introduct then explain everyth about space junk like what is space junk .
25824	9	author us an attent gather in introduct to start the articl . it also show what thi articl is about . in the bodi paragraph he gave us enough inform to support the fact .
25825	9	the author organ thi articl in differ section thei all have there own titl .
25826	9	the author organ the articl into three differ topic . in on the author describ what space junk is . in the second part the author tell about how satellit crash into on anoth . final in the last part the author describ how danger all the tini particl can truli be to our world . it also describ how harm the debri can be to spacecraft .
25827	9	by let the reader know what is go on and how we should understand what is go on and what could happen .
25828	9	the articl is organ veri prof fe signal and give a great outlin of inform to the reader . r
25829	9	the author organ the articl by time start it with the great space invas . he work hi wai from the past to the present . him start with the great space invas which start in . then he move on to dead satellit that crash into on anoth in februari . then he finish it up with the risk of tini space debri .
25830	9	the author organ the articl by us startl statement in the begin to attract the reader s attent . it begin by sai grab your telescop look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor then the articl get more seriou and explain the harm debri in space .
25831	9	he divid it by section of differ topic
25832	9	he organ it veri well i think becaus he put fact about the articl in the right spot . and it all just make sinc .
25833	9	he did put histori first so you can lean about what ha happen and the improv we have made . such as we where the first on the moon .
25834	9	the author organ the articl by talk about the soviet union first and then by talk about the us and russia . as shown in the soviet union launch the first artifici satellit . with no on at the control dead satellit run the risk of collid with each other . that s exactli what happen in februari . two commun satellit on american and on russian both travel at more than mile per hour crash into each other mile abov the earth . the impact creat hundr of piec of debri each assum it own orbit path . now instead of two disabl satellit there ar hundr of microsatellit fly through space .
25835	9	he first pull you in with a good introduct . then he explain what he is go to be talk about . after he give you that background inform he tell you the serious of the situat .
25836	9	thei but everyth in order in which thei ar go to talk about it . he she put everyth into grave detail which wa more easi for me to understand as i wa read the articl .

25838	9	he organ it veri simpl and and easili .
25839	9	the author organ thi articl by explain what exactli space junk is then give reason why it can be veri danger .
25840	9	tho author organ the articl in differ section or point . the author start with what is space junk which describ space junk . next come crash cours follow by littl bit but a big deal .
25841	9	the author organ the articl by give the basic inform need to understand the subject first . then by move on to more seriou matter and inform . she also organ the articl by topic and by give each section of topic it own titl .
25842	9	the author start out the articl with an introduct to catch your attent . he then tell you about space junk and tell when it began what it is and how it happen . he then goe on to sai what happen when thei do crash and the after effect . he tell an event that happen like the tool bag that came out of an astronaut s hand and is now travel through space . he goe on to tell the damag the space junk can do . the author wrap up the articl by state that space junk is a problem .
25843	9	the author start out plai
25844	9	he first tell us that space junk is a problem in our word to thi current dai and year . then he start to tell us when it first start that wa in when the soviet union launch there first satellit . the unit state fallow right behind them . there thei went into space close to each other everi dai . in the next year there ha been more space junk . thei have launch tone of differ space craft and some of them have loathsom part to the ship that thei where on . now it at the part were it tell where if the statut arent work that it caus a major threat to the world . becaus a dead aircraft or space ship if it hit someth that is work there is a po liabil that when thei hit each other that the work on will shut down becaus of it be hit and break . thu caus them both to hit earth and destroi land or kill some peopl in the cross . final it tell us how to complain how it would effect us on earth . if an aircraft or spaceship would hit someth in space it would damag the spacecraft and make more space junk .
25845	9	in a good understand wai .
25846	9	the author organ the articl in a logic wai . he begin by make a broad refer to what he is about to discuss . he doe thi while grab the reader s attent with shock statement and present a scenario that the reader can relat to . then he better describ the subject of the critic and how it came to be . in thi section he incorpor background knowledg and histor event that impact the problem . afterward he describ the actual problem . then he proce to explain why the problem is such a big deal and what is be done to prevent or protect against the problem .
25847	9	the author organ the articl by categor more threaten caus of space junk all lead up to the surprisingli big problem . he explain how space junk is caus and how simpl yet danger it can be .
25848	9	the author organ the articl in a veri clear orderli fashion . the articl start off with a catchi introduct . it sai grab your telescop look up in the sky it s a comet it s a meteor it s a . . . tool bag after thi the author switch from fun to a more seriou tone . he state thi space junk is current of great concern to govern space agenc around the globe . after the introduct the author explain what space junk realli is . he write the disabl object becom a piec of high tech junk circl the globe in uncontrol orbit . after he explain what it is he goe onto tell what might happen when two satellit collid . he sai now instead of two disabl satellit there ar hundr of microsatellit fly through space . after thi paragraph he goe on to tell us how thi debri can affect us . the author state tini fragment travel at a speed of five mile per second can inflict seriou damag on the most carefulli design spacecraft . the author then wrap it all up with hi conclus .
25849	9	micro mean small so micro did re mean small did re .
25850	9	he talk about space and the astronaut and the space junk how it can fall from space .
25851	9	the author describ what exactli the space junk actual is in thi case it satellit and other thing includ small piec of the satellit . then follow with the crash cours part of the write that tell how the junk got there includ satellit crash . also the littl bit of junk mai not seem that there a problem but the littl bit but big deal section tell that there is a problem with the littl price of junk to .
25852	9	he organ the articl into differ section which he then titl like littl bit but a big problem in each of these part he talk about a differ subject that still pertain to the thesi .
25853	9	first the author make a statement that how onc orbit pathwai were clear in space but ar now fill with space derbi . then the author explain to us the histori of space and how variou amount of object have been sent in space or lost in space . new the author state how there is nobodi control these object that when thei ar dead or fulli us thei just roam around in space at highli danger speed and even the littlest of part could caus great damag to object . now scientist ar try to corpor nation so thei can work togeth to come up with a viabl solut to space pollut .
25854	9	he start out with when the first artifici satellit wa launch and then about some of the crash that have happen and final he talk about random space junk .
25855	9	the author first gain audienc attent with a brief summari of the problem of space junk and then in success group of paragraph flesh out the problem . hi first group introduc the subject s histori start with the space race and the first accid . the second group specif describ the result and likelihood of collis . the third group describ the impact of microdebri slam into larger satellit .
25856	9	with on section talk about space junk anoth defin space junk on talk about satellit on about satellit collis on about debri anoth about nasa .
25857	9	thei go from some small thing to larger trash like satellit . thei all talk about how harm the thing ar though . thei also start with the histori of the space race which i think is good right after the intro .
25858	9	thi author organ the articl simpli introduct to the concept of space junk the great space invas which ultim lead to a crash cours in space junk and conclus of the damag that these microdebri can do to the earth or even aircraft that ar on their wai to explor outer space . the author entic the reader with their open three exclam and hook them on the idea of a tool bag in outer space . then the author add inform about about what space junk actual is befor tell the reader of the crash that result in space junk . final the author write tini fragment travel at a speed of five mile per second can inflict seriou damag on the most carefulli design spacecraft . if you find that hard to believ compar grain of sand blown by a gentl breez to those shot from a sandblast to strip paint from a concret wall . thi statement is us to shock the reader into realiz just how danger thi space junk realli is .
25859	9	first he hint that space explor is a danger matter . then he explain why artifici satellit ar in space . then lastli he explain in depth to danger of microdebri .
25860	9	he organ it by give detail first
25861	9	the author organ the articl by first introduc the topic of discuss then give a histori of how the space debri got there then explain how some satellit becom smaller and deadlier and lastli by explain that it is a major problem .
25862	9	the author organ the articl in a topic by topic wai . the articl is separ into four mini section . each section ha a few paragraph on a certain topic . for exampl the section titl what is space junk is all about space junk and what is it . anoth exampl is the section titl littl bit but a big deal it talk about how even though the materi in space ar small thei still make a big impact and peopl care .
25863	9	the author organ the articl by tell us what space junk is then tell us how much of a big deal it is to us and how we can get rid of it .
25864	9	the author organ the articl in a wai that emphas how space junk can be harm .
25865	9	the author organ the arriv with an attent get statement first and second he goe into detail about how space junk get into the earth s atmospher . third he or she explain how the satellit have risk of collid with each other and what happen to the debri and fourth the author talk about the rate of the tini debri fragment and about how the scientist ar look for an easi solut to get rid of space junk
25866	9	he talk about the reason why space junk is danger to the atmospher and the satellit in space caus them to crash eventu due to the difficulti it is to steer clear of the debri .
25867	9	the author organ the articl by us the last sentenc of a section to lead into the next section . for exampl the last sentenc of the introduct mention that the space junk is a great concern around the world then the author continu the next section what is space junk explain the reason why space junk were creat . thi section conclud with a sentenc sai the disabl satellit object circl the orbit uncontrol which lead into the next section where it explain the danger of the dead satellit collid with each other . thi method creat the effect of question and answer which allow the reader to absorb the complex inform slowli and thoroughli .
25868	9	the author organ the articl into subsect that oper both in the gener context of the articl and under their own head . these section ar organ so that the reader learn more about space junk it histori and the danger it present in a logic order . the author start with defin space junk and progress to the final head littl bit but a big deal which ultim state that the author s true purpos in write thi articl is to illustr to the reader how big a problem space junk is for the world .
25869	9	how the orbit junk get into slave . he first start off the articl with someth that will grab read thought s . second he talk about the crash cours on what the harm thing out ar space ar . there thing the author talk s about is littl bit but a big deal it talk about how the it increas more about what we know about space . in conclus he is do the right thing about space and how fun it is to float around in the space shuttl .
25870	9	the author organ the space junk of the concern to the govern space agenc around the globe .
25871	9	the author organ the articl by put each thing in it own categori . for exampl littl bit but a big deal is about sat li crash .
25872	9	he get your attent than express the import of space junk than he tell you what space junk is he tell you about what space junk ha done in the past and lastli he stress again that space junk is a big deal .
25873	9	he mainli just put it togeth veri nice and is comfort with write what he s got or what he ha .
25874	9	the author organ the articl by first start off with littl question or sai . then move onto import fact about space life and when thing have happen . the author give date of differ thing and also give reason behind why he is talk about that certain topic at that given moment . the author also organ the articl by crash cours . next with littl bit but a big deal . he talk about a lot but separ each topic .
25875	9	he arrang it in an order that make more sens as you read further . he start off with the histori of space explor . then it goe into problem that can occur .
25876	9	the author organ thi stori with the problem more stuff wrong with space travel then a solut to the problem then goe back to some more problem then sum it up with what we could do to help .
25877	9	the author organ hi articl veri well . he first grab your attent with excit exclam and tell what hi articl will mostli talk about . he then explain in depth the subject of hi articl space junk . after he explain thi he talk about how the space junk end up where it is . final he talk about how big of an impact thi space junk creat and who is respons for thi .
25878	9	the author organ the work into sub categori with their own titl . for exampl what is space junk and crash cours . these head where veri help the the organ of the long articl .
25879	9	the author organ hi articl by put it in paragraph structur
25880	9	the author organ the articl with head within the articl and in the section of the head explain what the head is talk about .
25881	9	in the introduct the author talk about look into the a night sky to see thing in space while do so thei see a tool bag . the tool bag is us to talk about what the author call space junk . as the stori goe on the author talk about what space junk realli is then goe on to talk about that it can caus crash and then on to the size of debri .
25882	9	the author us a titl for each segment . flow the reader stai on track .
25883	9	the author organ the articl by introduc us to the topic and then us three differ section to give us inform about space junk . the introduct includ the author s thesi and then he expand on it in the next three section . the what is space junk section give us detail on what space junk realli is and how it come about . the crash cours section talk about the danger of dead satellit collid in orbit by provid us with an exampl of a russian and american satellit collid in . the littl bit but a big deal section is provid us inform on why space junk is actual a seriou problem becaus of the damag it can inflict . the author organ the inform in a wai that reader can understand and realli learn about the impact space junk ha .
25884	9	the author organ in the articl by give head for each section . for exampl what is space junk provid us clue that that section is go to explain to the reader what space junk is . crash cours is go to tell us how satellit sometim collid with other satellit in space and so on .
25885	9	the author tell of the danger and of the power of the small space junk ha like the tool bag it can be veri danger do to the power and forc that it orbit with
25886	9	the author first tri to get your attent by us examin . then the author tell about fact about danger in space .
25887	9	he organ the articl to show us how everyth work how he start out by us orbit junk to get us to see what it mainli bout then he take us on dealt to let us know why he tell us then . then he goe onto explain why thi stuff happen what it doe to the space ship and let us know why we should care .
25888	9	the author start the articl off with what the space junk is befor tell peopl how it is a problem . he want peopl to know what it wa so that thei knew what he wa talk about . if the reader knew what he wa talk about then thei would see how it a problem in space and how it is not good for space .
25889	9	by introduc a problem and then give evid on it and true statement .
25890	9	the author grab the reader attent at first . then thei go into conclus about what space junk is and describ it . after that the author talk about a crash cours that happen in the past . the author then talk about how a littl bit of space junk is a big deal . sinc you alreadi know about space junk you know it can be a big deal . he then finish it off by state that hopefulli america and other countri can get togeth and help solv the problem of so much space junk in the air .
25891	9	the author organ the articl by put everyth in the order . talk about what is space junk .
25892	9	the author organ it by sai what normal peopl would sai . becaus a lot of peopl don t know anyth about space . he tell us what it realli is . he goe into tell what space junk is . and how it effect the satellit the risk of collid into each other . he chang the tone after the introduct to realli tell us that it s a big deal .
25893	9	the author organ the articl in a wai that would catch the read attent the slowli work it wai into the more seriou matter for exampl the danger of space junk and the damag that it can caus to our space shuttl and our planet . it wa plan out well most peopl don t want to read about space nor do thei care but the author wrote thi in a manner that wa respect and peculiar . thei did not blame anyon the earli just believ that thi is a seriou manner that need to be resolv somehow befor it becom a deadli problem to astronaut . in fact the amount of space trash is actual increas becaus commerci space travel is on the rise and more nation have undertaken space explor the author at thi point ha a forewarn tone she isn t condon thi but thei would much enjoi if everyon found a wai to find a solut to the problem .
25894	9	the author start off with a introduct then move on and talk about space junk . after that he goe from topic to topic .
25895	9	the author organ the articl in section like chapter to get the full detail of the stori . the section ar head with a main detail to inform you what come up in the section .
25896	9	the author organ thi articl with an introduct hi main bodi paragraph with hi main topic and final a conclus . just like a five paragraph essai .
25897	9	the author organ the articl us sub head . what is space junk crash cours littl bit but a big deal
25898	9	the author organ it in section to make it easier to follow and understand the import of space junk . you learn in the first section that satellit can be shut down . you also learn that accid happen in space .
25899	9	the author organ the articl by section that lead into each other .
25900	9	the author organ the articl by strateg order the topic he talk about in order of import .
25901	9	the author get your attent first then get to the fact then the import of the space junk . he want to get you pull in so that you can get excit and want to know more about it . the author bring up the histori of the thing that happen to let you know that thi could happen again easili .
25902	9	the author first explain what space junk is and then goe on to write about some of the space junk that ha exist . he tell about how danger and can be and ar make peopl awar of it . thi bit of space debri present a veri seriou problem sai the writer try to emphas how it can be danger .
25903	9	the author organ the articl by describ everi detail of space junk possibl . he she begin by explain what space junk is . then the author give possibl problem and outcom . lastli the author describ why space junk is a big deal and veri danger .
25904	9	the author organ hi articl veri well i think . i think that the author ha everi bit of inform in perfect order . he ha veri mani fact to back up hi inform he explain how loos tool in space would effect space craft and peopl on earth . i think that the author support hi articl greatli .
25905	9	the author organ hi inform by how much certain piec of it relat with other piec of inform . such as you wouldn t find ani inform that defin space junk in the paragraph entitl crash cours .
25906	9	the author talk about what it is . then he give a descript of space junk . then the author talk about the crash cours and how you cant control a satellit or anyth like that from run into space deer . then the author talk about how the littlest particl of space deer can be veri danger if it get up to speed and hit anoth object at a fast speed .
25907	9	the author organ the articl into section about differ detail about space junk . each section contain differ detail and inform about the space junk . first in what is space junk the author explain what space junk realli is . thei give inform about how some of the junk can circl the world for indefinit how some of it will never ever go awai and can caus harm and problem . second in the section crash cours the author explain how object up in space can crash into on anoth and can caus mani problem . even a simpl tool bag lost in space could have a harm effect . lastli in littl bit but a big deal thei tell how mani peopl actual care how much space trash there is . some of the effect of the space junk can caus just as much damag as a sand blaster to a paint concret wall .
25908	9	the author organ the articl veri well the entir articl wa veri organ .
25909	9	the author organ the articl by first tell us about space junk and what it is . then goe into crash cours tell us about what happen with a crash cours . final the author talk littl bit but a big deal . littl bit but big deal caus a disastr hole in an object move in space .
25910	9	the author organ thi articl by put the histor inform first . he she let us know when space satellit were first put into space and what ha happen sinc then with the explor . then the author goe on to explain what happen to all the clutter left behind in the explor themselv like the two commun satellit crash and the tool bag that wa lost by an astronaut do repair . final the author let us know that mani peopl do care about the debri and that nasa and the european space agenc ha found a wai to tell just how big some of the debri is . although thei can t see thing smaller than a basebal thei can tell that the space trash amount is increas .
25911	9	the author organ the articl by first us a hook a well known phrase to catch the reader attent . after that thei us explan interest fact and a summari of the problem and a possibl solut .
25912	9	by
25913	9	the author begin the articl with a simpl tone which lead into a more seriou yet inform tone .
25914	9	the order of the articl is arrang in a veri organ wai first the author grab the reader s attent by make the subject interest with reader interact . then the problem is brought up and explain first by defin what the problem is and why it is a problem . final the articl is conclud with a statement of an idea on how to illumin the problem .
25915	9	the author start the articl out by sai it s a comet it s a meteor it s a . . . tool bag which then lead into talk about space junk . then the author talk about some histori of spacecraft and other object . the author then talk about differ crash have to do with satellit . final the author goe on to talk about tini fragment can be danger .
25916	9	the author of the articl orbit junk organ the articl in a specif wai . the author first start out by gain the reader s attent by us shock statement . the first sentenc grab your telescop look up in the sky it s a comet it a meteor is us to make the reader think someth bad is about to happen . the reader might think that a meteor is crash down to earth or that someth els danger might happen . after gain the reader s attent the author then goe on to sai that it is noth more that a tool bag . the reader most like now think that the begin narrat is not actual look up into space when thei actual ar . the reader is probabl now curiou as to what the begin narrat is look at . the author now explain that what the narrat is see is space junk . thi paragraph explain that the begin narrat is see space junk is entic the reader into want to read more . in the next section label what is space junk is us to explain exactli what space junk is . the author us these paragraph to explain that space junk can be just about anyth . in the section crash cours the author us actual event that have occur to explain to the reader that even malfunct satellit can becom space junk if thei complet quit work or if thei ar unabl to be control by peopl on earth anymor . in the final section of the articl littl bit but a big deal the author summar that all the differ piec of space junk can be as larg as a satellit to smaller than a basebal . the author explain that object smaller than a basebal ar unabl to be detect and becaus of thi the space ship that orbit into space have to have more layer of wall and protect to protect them from the microdebri . thi articl is organ in a wai to help the reader understand all that thei can about what space junk is and what problem it mai caus . the author ha a veri effici wai of organ the articl and the articl is easi to understand .
25917	9	the author organ hi articl into section start with an introduct . then the author move into the main point of what he is try to get across to the reader . first he talk about the histori of satellit in what is space junk . in crash cours he talk about how satellit collid . then in the last section littl bit but a big deal he talk about what to do as a solut to thi harm problem .
25918	9	with fact first .
25919	9	the author organ the articl to catch the reader ey at the start and then to inform them of the pollut of the space todai . he organ it that each paragraph had it on kind of inform also titl them so that the inform that the reader wa look for could be found easili .
25920	9	the author organ the articl into main section . each section discuss a particular part of space junk . these section includ what it is how it got there and why is it import . he support these with fact and exampl .
25921	9	he put it in to categori and explain them
25922	9	thi articl is organ differ then most . it start with somewhat of a dialogu then turn into fact . it ask question then defin the answer well .
25923	9	he organ it in paragraph form which is put into part to give you reason to believ that space junk is danger to the space shuttl .
25924	9	the author made it so that the more import detail where at the begin the the end of the articl . by do so he wa abl to keep the reader attent for the entir time thei were read it . make it so that the reader want to read it is most like to be on of the hardest thing that the author had to do . in the beg he tell about what happen to the satellit and at the end he tell about how the degre is a major factor in space .
25925	9	the author give a problem then explain it . thei then explain what caus the problem and what effect it ha . then thei give solut to the problem along with other detail .
25926	9	badli caus thei just kinda jump around and dont get right to the point
25927	9	the author organ the articl in a flow order to make the reader better abl to understand what he she is read . the author start by explain what start creat space junk to appear outsid earth s atmospher then went on to how thing can go into their own orbit and that increas space research is onli make the matter of space junk wors .
25928	9	the author organ the articl by import . thei had the attent letter first . after the attent letter thei explain what space junk is . then thei state more startl statist about space crash . lastli thei explain how space junk compar to other thing and emphas how danger it is .
25929	9	the author organ the articl by get the reader interest in the articl and then by show the reader that space junk is bad and that it can damag the earth everi time the space junk crash into the earth . accord to paragraph ten it state scientist ar hard press for an easi solut to the problem of space junk paragraph . thi state that it is a hard time to keep it safe .
25930	9	the author explain that and how space junk is a seriou matter no matter what size it is .
25931	9	the author organ thi articl into question the reader mai have about space explor . the author then give a short incid that relat to that question and explain .
25932	9	the author start by grab the reader attent . thei then go on to explain what space junk actual is and after thi thei explain some situat in which the debri is creat with the section entitl crash cours . the last but certainli not least movement that the author make toward organ is to explain what the import and serious of space junk . the author certainli emphas the danger that astronaut face when thei ar sent on mission in the last section .
25933	9	the author start you calm and fun but then he goe in to easili a list of what he she is talk about . he she goe into ask what is space junk . tell you fact and keep in interest then move on to more topic that ha the same feel to it .
25934	9	the author organ the articl by first explain what space junk is . when the author gave the reader inform about space junk he explain the mani wai that the junk mai get into space . last the author inform the reader that the littl bit of space junk float around can actual caus major damag .
25935	9	thei begin by tell about how space junk ha clutter up orbit pathwai and how thei ar danger and then thei provid exampl of thing that ha happen to show that space junk is danger and final talk about how the issu is becom a bigger concern everi dai with more space junk pile up into the orbit pathwai .
25936	9	thei organ it in a veri clean cut wai . thei have everyth in order so it is easi to read and flow veri good .
25937	9	he tell the stori in order
25938	9	the author goe from the first satellit . then begin to tell us that it is danger if satellit crash into each other . final the author begin to sai how bad it is if the satellit crash into each other .
25939	9	the author organ the articl into four organ section . the first section is titl orbit junk and thi is the introductori paragraph that overview the entir write piec . the next section introduc the histori of space and how the space junk appear there . the third section is titl crash cours and thi tell actual fact about a time when two satellit actual crash while in orbit . thi help give more statist about the write . the last section call littl bit but a big deal explain how thi problem affect us and how we can help .
25940	9	the articl state that the soviet union wa the first to send a satellit in to space . and then it talk about other satellit go in to space .
25941	9	the author organ the articl in order of the old thing first then go into the futur . under what is space junk is and goe over the next year . crash cours is the now and littl bit but a big deal is the futur . that is how the author organ the articl .
25942	9	the author section hi articl from hi main idea of space junk and then condens it down to the compos element such as littl bit but a big deal and explain all of the smaller contribut to the bigger problem . also he section off the effect of space junk in the section titl crash cours .
25943	9	the author organ the articl in an effici orderli and easi to read manner . the author creat differ section with differ titl such as what is space junk and crash cours . each differ section discuss a certain topic . for exampl what is space junk discuss how research satellit can becom debri in space . these multipl section help the reader to focu on a certain topic at a time . in addit becaus all of the section ar in a logic order thei give the reader an easier transit into the next topic . for exampl a reader who is read thi articl would first be wonder about space junk and then how it is made . in the articl the author first discuss what space junk is and then discuss in the section crash cours how it is made .
25944	9	the author organ the articl in a wai to inform peopl . he she describ space junk in order for peopl read thi to understand what is be talk about . the author then us specif date to show the sever of the problem .
25945	9	it tell you about how the space junk got there and how it get out of space and it talk about how crash cours and it talk about littl bit but a big deal who thei all get in to space .
25946	9	he organ it by talk about space and the satellit . then he talk about how satellit have crash into each other creat space junk . and it talk about how these small piec of junk ar a huge deal becaus some satellit can pick them up on the radar and how the piec of junk travel veri fast through space and can do lot of damag .
25947	9	he organ thi stori but catch your ey at first . then he tell you about the histori of that . then find out fact of them .
25948	9	the author organ the arriv by us support detail event that have occur thing that might happen and histori on space .
28135	10	light grai that color will keep the doghous cool when it hot but not too cold that it would be uncomfort for the dog . i believ thi becaus the light grai ha an averag temperatur of 45 deg c . the white is three degre lower than that the dark grai wa three degre abov light grai and black wa anoth five degre abov that .
28136	10	black black is more attract to the sun and it make more thing warmer or hotter
28137	10	light grai i pick light grai becaus it not to hot of a color and not to cold of a color
28138	10	white it will keep it cooler insid becaus white reflect heat which mean it wouldnt be enter the hous .
28139	10	light grai paint the doghous light grai will affect th temp . by make it warm . not too cool and not too hot . for exampl in the result light grai wa 45 deg c while black wa 53 deg c and white wa 42 deg c .
28140	10	white it should reflect more thermal energi becaus the higher flow resent look while black is dark and absorb more thermal energi
28141	10	white that color would keep the doghous colder than the other on . white reflect light and darker color absorb the heat .
28142	10	black the black will creat more energi in the doghous for more air temperatur .
28143	10	light grai light grai will affect the doghous by keep it warm becaus light grai is doe not absorb a lot of energi but it absolv enough energi to keep the doghous warm .
28144	10	dark grai i chose dark grai for the color the doghous should be paint becaus doghous ar us to keep the dog warm at night or for shade on a hot dai and the color is even on both . for exampl it cold outsid 24 deg c and the dog goe insid the doghous which is about 48 deg the dog is better of in the doghous .
28145	10	black if you paint a doghous black then if the sun wa out the doghous will be warmer than it would be if it wa ani other color . dure the glass jar experi black had a averag temperatur of 53 deg which wa 5 deg higher than the second hottest color .
28146	10	white the white color absorb less heat from the sun than black color . thi will help the dog keep cool and fresh . the dog will not be hot if the color is white . the averag of the white color is 4 2 deg c . the averag of black is 53 deg c . so what color is the coolest the answer is white .
28147	10	black if thei us black paint for their doghous then heat with stai in becaus black absorb heat .
28148	10	white the color white would make the doghous veri cool becaus it said in the passag that the darker the color the hotter it get becaus it absorb the energi . so by choos white i think the dog and the dog hous will be alto cooler
28149	10	white thi color would keep the doghous cooler becaus in the experi the white lid heat had an averag of 42 deg c and the black lid had an averag of 53 deg c . the white lid wa 11 deg cooler than the black lid .
28150	10	black you should us black becaus that attract the most heat and can beth warmest temperatur for the dog .
28151	10	black the color black might affect the doghous by the temperatur stai at a comfort level so it not too hot and not too cold just like in the experi how the dark black lid stai on averag a comfort 53 deg .
28152	10	white white is the best choic becaus accord to the tabl it attract the least amount of heat therefor it is the best option .
28153	10	dark grai in the winter it well deep the doghous warm but not so much that the dog get heatstrok in the summer .
28154	10	white if you paint the doghous white then your dog will stai much cooler on hot dai becaus white reflect heat awai .
28155	10	light grai thi wai the doghous doesnt get too hot from the sun becaus you can see from brandi and jerri s experi that have a dark color doghous could make it too hot for the dog but have it complet white might make it too cold . thi is becaus dark color absorb more light .
28156	10	white i would choos white becaus it reflect the sun and back make it hotter .
28157	10	black the black would make the doghous warmer insid for the doggi .
28158	10	white white will make the doghous cooler . like in the lid color vs . air temperatur insid glass jar experi . the white lid had a cooler temperatur compar to black dark grai and light grai .
28159	10	white the white color will reflect most of the radiat wave so that it will be cooler in the doghous .
28160	10	black black paint color is 53 degre and white paint color is 42 degre that 11 degre warmer than white
28161	10	dark grai it will make the doghous warm
28162	10	white the color white might effect the doghous by sinc color white is not a dark color it doesnt absorb as much heat as dark color do so the doghous could be cooler by ad a lighter color to the doghous .
28163	10	light grai
28164	10	light grai becaus if color is dark it is gonna have more temperatur but if color is light it is gonna have less temperatur .
28165	10	black there will be more light insid of the dog hous and more heat .
28166	10	white you wouldnt wanna us a dark color for the dog hous becaus the darker the color the more the color absorb energi from the sun caus the insid of the doghous to get hotter thu inca us the dog to overheat . not a good thing fora dog . after the him in of test each color of lid white had an averag temperatur of 42 deg c and black had an averag temp enur of 53 deg c . white had 11 deg c less then black did
28167	10	white i chose white becaus the color reflect the most amount of heat data from the tabl show that the darker the color the hotter the temperatur the color collect . therefor the doghous should be alight color .
28168	10	dark grai i think that dark grai would beth best choic i think thi becaus dark grai will allow for some warm air to enter on a cold dai . also on a hot dai it will not absorb to much heat for the hous to overheat . dai that support thi is in the experi black te futur increas the most start at 24 deg c and rise to 53 deg c . when the white onli rose to 42 deg c start also at 24 deg c . when dark grai wa somewhat in the middl with 48 deg c start at 24 deg c .
28169	10	light grai it well affect a lie bit . becaus it light grai .
28170	10	white it will make the insid of the doghous cooler becaus the averag temperatur wa 42 deg c and black which is the darkest color wa on averag 53 deg c .
28171	10	white when summer come the dog will be nice and cool insid the doghous with the sun hit the doghous becaus the white paint wont attract the heat as much as black paint would . so the dog will be nice and cool instead of hot and sad .
28172	10	white thi color white mai affect the doghous with heat . the white keep the room cool becaus it not a dark color like black so it doesnt attract the sun and heat so much . if you were to us the tabl in the experi as a refer you would see that white keep the jar the coolest out of all the color .
28173	10	white if you choos the color white fora doghous then accord to the glass jar data the doghous would be cooler then if it wa a black doghous .
28174	10	white white might affect the doghous becaus it wont attract as much heat the averag is 42 deg c
28175	10	light grai the color of the doghous is depend on the climat in which the dog is live . for instanc a black dog hous is best suit to a cold climat like alaska where it would help to keep the doghous warm dure the cold winter . but if you live ina warm climat like san diego the best color for the doghous would be white . the white would help to reflect the heat keep the dog cool dure the hot summer . if the dog live in northwestern washington i would sai the best color for the doghous is light grai . the light grai would keep the dog warmer in the the winter than the white . the data provid show that the light grai is on averag 3 deg warmer thant he white . but would allow the dog to be cool enough in the summer as the light grai is on averag 3 deg cooler than the dark grai and 7 deg c color than the black . if i had to choos a color for the doghous i would choos light grai as it would work best for the area in which i live . thi question wa written poorli becaus there isnt a definit answer and therefor is a matter of opinion . more inform should be given in the question to help the student make the correct choic .
28176	10	light grai light grei is about good temperatur fora dog ina doghous . warm . the tabl sai that light grei and dark grei ar between white and black so i chose someth in the middl .
28177	10	white the color white would affect the insid of the doghous by keep it cool . in the experi the white lid color had an averag of 42 deg c while black had an averag of 53 deg c . that s a differ of 11 deg . a doghous that s white should keep the dog nice and cool in the summer .
28178	10	light grai light grai will attract a littl light but not to much . black would attract a lot of heat and that wouldnt be good so would dark grai but light grai wouldnt attract as much and white wouldn t realli attract ani heat .
28179	10	white white is the best color to paint the dog hous becaus white absorb the least amount of heat .
28180	10	white i would us white for the doghous roof becaus it would keep the doghous cooler insid for the dog . in the experi when a white lid wa us it averag chang in temperatur wa 11 deg c less than the averag temperatur chang us the black lid conclud that a lighter color roof will keep the doghous cooler .
28181	10	white white would beth best paint color becaus on a sunni hot dai it would keep the insid of the doghous cooler than a darker color doghous . thi can be proven becaus in the experi the black lid had an averag insid temperatur of 53 deg c and the white lid had an averag insid temperatur of 42 deg c . therefor a white doghous would be 11 deg c cooler than the black doghous .
28182	10	white if we paint the dog hous white then it would get more cooler becaus white mostli attract about c .
28183	10	white thi color will affect the doghous by decreas the temperatur heat and it will actual caus the doghous to be more cooler .
28184	10	dark grai suck it
28185	10	white thi will effect the doghous becaus the lighter the color the less attract tobi the sun or heat sourc . result from the text sai the averag temperatur insid the glass jar with the white lid wa 42 deg c and the start temperatur wa 24 deg c .
28186	10	black it is the darkest
28187	10	white the color i chose mai effect the doghous becaus differ color react differ in certain temperatur for exampl white absorb it .
28188	10	white the color will affect the doghous temperatur becaus if you paint a doghous black it would make it all hot insid . but if you paint it white it will stai cool and moist .
28189	10	black thi color would affect threat in the dog hous becaus black attract heat . thi you should us if the dog need tow arm becaus the averag temp wa c c more than the last on
28190	10	white white would reflect the heat and the dog hous would be cooler
28191	10	black thi color of the doghous might make it to hot for the dog . the averag of the black is 53 degre and the averag for the white is 42 degre .
28192	10	black the color is realli dark and can get it to be realli hot insid and the dog might die if there is no fresh cold air .
28193	10	light grai i chose light grai and it might effect the dog hous by keep the doghous not to hot and not to cold becaus it is the color with the medium amount of heat
28194	10	dark grai it wont make it too hot or too cold it will be just right
28195	10	white the color affect the outhous in that the lighter the color the cooler it stai . which is good becaus dog cant overheat and the darker it is the hotter it get insid .
28196	10	white the paint color white will make the insid of the doghous the least hot becaus base on the result white had the lowest air temperatur if thei us white the insid wont get too hot
28197	10	white paint a doghous white would keep the insid of the doghous cooler than other color would .
28198	10	white i would choos white so the doghous doe not get to hot insid . black would heat the doghous to much .
28199	10	dark grai it will keep the same temp becaus in the data tabl it sai 48 for trial 1 48 for trial 2 48 for trial 3 and as on can see 48 will obvious beth averag
28200	10	black the black paint will keep to warm insid the doghous to keep the dog warm .
28201	10	white brandi and jerri might want to color the doghous white becaus the data show that the averag temperatur 42 deg c after 10 minut will keep the dog the coolest insid a white color doghous .
28202	10	white the hous will beat the coldest temperatur that it can be out of all the other color .
28203	10	white that color will make the doghous cooler becaus thei wa studi to find out if dark color chang the temp and the white is the cooler on with all the trial thei did .
28204	10	white the color will either make it hotter or colder insid the doghous thi is why i would choos white to paint the doghous becaus in the experi it creat the lowest temperatur in the jar .
28205	10	white if the color wa darker the air insid would get hotter than if the color wa lighter . accord to the data from the experi the darker color heat up more than the lighter color
28206	10	black i choos the color black for it will make the doghous warmer to live in . for the hot lamp experi show that the darker the lid color the warmer the air is insid . for when the lid wa black it had an averag of 53 deg c and when the lid wa white it had an averag temperatur of 42 deg . with a differ of 11 deg .
28207	10	white white would beth best color becaus on a hot summer dai the insid of a white doghous would not be nearli as hot as the insid of a black or dark grai or even alight grai doghous . and the color white absorb the least heat than all of the other color do so white would be your best bet fora nice cool doghous .
28208	10	black black would beth best color becaus the darker the color the more energi it absorb so the doghous will be warmer and heat .
28209	10	white white doesnt attract as much light energi as darker color would .
28210	10	light grai how thi color might affect the doghous is becaus it isnt too hot or cold it is the coolest on the averag is 45 deg c . and the black on is 53 deg c and white is 42 deg c .
28211	10	white in the experi white wa the least hot so i would us whit to keep te dog nice and cool and by us white u will be abl to seeth doghous in the nite witch give ran into mine at nite it suck
28212	10	black paint the doghous black would make it warmer for the dog .
28213	10	black if brandi and jerri live ina colder climat i would recommend them paint the hous black becaus as you can tell by the experi result the darker the color the warmer it will be insid .
28214	10	white that is go to make it hot in the for the dog .
28215	10	dark grai it would keep the doghous at a warm tempt re not to hot or not to cold .
28216	10	dark grai dark grei would keep the doghous warmer in the cold weather becaus due to the test result it wa warmer than insid the white doghous . in the summer when it hot dark grei wouldnt be too hot for the dog unlik the color black which would have kept the doghous warmer than it need to be in the summertim .
28217	10	white if the doghous wa a dark color dark grai or black the it would be veri hot in there . if it wa light grai or white it would be perfect temperatur .
28218	10	black us black paint to paint the doghous would beth best becaus it would absorb the most heat so it would keep the dog the warmest . i know thi becaus in the result from the experi in trial 1 the air insid the jar with the black lid had a temperatur of 54 deg c after 10 minut . the jar with the dark grei lid had a temperatur of 48 deg c after 10 minut . the jar with the light grai lid had a temperatur of 44 deg c after 10 minut . and the jar with the white lid had a temperatur of 42 deg c after 10 minut . so thi result data prove that black absorb the most heat so that should beth color to paint the doghous so that the dog is warmer . becaus if it made the insid of ajar warmer it will most like make the insid of a doghous warmer .
28219	10	white thi color cannot make it so hot in the summer so the dog can rest insid of it . as shown in the experi the white color wa the least hottest temperatur .
28220	10	black black would attract more energi
28221	10	white brandi and jerri should us white paint to color the doghous . in the experi the result show that white paint ha the lowest averag temperatur at 42 deg c the black had 53 deg c the dark grai had 48 deg c and light grai had 45 deg c . thi prove that white color will have the lowest temperatur in the doghous .
28222	10	dark grai black would beth best paint color for the doghous becaus it will absorb the most heat and keep the doghous warm .
28223	10	dark grai dark grei will keep the doghous warm in the winter and cooler then black in the summer . the black as shown in theta be wa definit the warmest with an averag temperatur of 53 deg c . dark grei had an averag of 48 deg c light grei had 45 deg c and white wa onli 42 deg c . with a rang of 42 53 i believ that dark grei be somewher in the middl wa a good choic for all season .
28224	10	white becaus it reflect the sun radiat unlik all the other that attract the sun radiat
28225	10	dark grai well for 1 . what type of dog is it . 2 . depend on the type of year it is .
28226	10	dark grai keep it warmer then light grai or white for the winter but keep it cooler then black for the summer
28227	10	dark grai thei might want to us the dark grai paint becaus when the sun hit it it wont get to hot and when there is not sun it wont get to cold . i discov thi by look at the result of the experi and thei show that after ten minut of the light hit the dark grai it wa about 48 deg c and the temp stai consist throughout the trial .
28228	10	black thi color might affect the doghous by make it former becaus the darker the color the former the doghous will be .
28229	10	white the color white would effect the doghous becaus the temperatur would stai cooler when the sun is out becaus white doesnt absorb as much energi than darker color do . that wai the dog wouldn t overheat . thi is prove in the experi becaus the white lid caus the air to have an averag temperatur of 42 deg c which wa the coolest temperatur . black which wa the darkest color made the air have an averag temperatur of 53 deg c .
28230	10	white white would bring the doghous cooler . thi is shown by the result in the past experi . with the white color lid on the jar be the coldest temperatur .
28231	10	white it will be cooler in the summer but still war min the winter the averag temp were wa deg c
28232	10	white if you were to paint the doghous white it would be cool insid in the summer becaus white reflect heat energi more than light grai dark grai and black black absorb heat energi .
28233	10	black black would affect he insid of the doghous becaus dark color absorb heat and black would increas the indoor temperatur .
28234	10	dark grai dark grai would affect the temperatur insid of the doghous by make it a littl warmer but not to hot . in the experi to see if the color affect the temperatur black wa the hottest . white wa the coolest . i pick dark grai becaus it stai 48 deg the whole time and would not be to hot or to cold .
28235	10	dark grai i choos dark grei becaus it will keep the dog hous warm in winter . but cool in the summer .
28236	10	white i think that white would beth best color to paint the doghous . white would beth best becaus it stai the coolest . in the investig the lid color that stai the coldest wa the white lid . the averag temperatur for the white lid wa 42 deg c . while the other were 53 deg c for black 48 deg c for dark grai and 45 deg c for light grai . if i were the dog i would want a nice cool hous becaus i wouldnt want to feel all hot and stuffi .
28237	10	white black becaus the doghous would catch on fire .
28238	10	black it might keep the doghous warm at night
28239	10	white the white paint on a doghous would ensur that the doghous would never be to hot fora dog to safe live within it . in thi experi brandi and jerri put differ color lid on glass jar fill with air that wa at the start of the experi at 24 deg c . thei then heat 4 jar with differ color lid under a hot lamp to see which color black dark grai light grai or white would effect t the air temperatur within the jar the most . after three trial on each of the four jar brandi and jerri averag the temperatur for each jar after be heat . black the hottest color on averag rose 30 deg c after ten minut while white onli rose an averag of 18 deg . so if brandi and jerri were also build a doghous then thei would want to paint it white becaus the temperatur of the air within would not becom danger in the summer month when the ambient temperatur becom higher .
28240	10	white it wouldnt be to hot fora dog
28241	10	white i would paint the doghous white becaus it would keep the dog cool when it hot outsid i know thi becaus in the data tabl white wa the coldest color
28242	10	white the color might affect the doghous becaus the averag of the white color is 42 and it will not keep it warm insid the doghous . and the other color temperatur averag is 45 48 .
28243	10	white white ha an averag temperatur of 42 which will make it much more cooler in the doghous than ani of the other dark color who temperatur is 45 or higher accord to the data tabl
28244	10	white the color of the doghous should be white becaus it would be cooler insid the doghous around 42 deg c . if it wa a darker color it would be warmer in the doghous around 53 deg c .
28245	10	dark grai it will affect the doghous becaus dark color absorb heat so if the dog get cold it would have heat also when it dirti you still can see it so it will be clean
28246	10	dark grai i think that the dark grai doghous is the best color becaus in the winter it will be warm in sid and in the summer it will be cold outsid becaus it averag temperatur is sorta in them middl 48 deg of all the averag temperatur .
28247	10	white white would beth best color becaus in the experi black had an averag temperatur of 53 deg c dark grai had an averag of 48 deg c light grai had an averag of 45 deg c and white had an averag of 42 deg c . white had a differ of 11 deg c from black make it abett choic to keep a doghous cool .
28248	10	white white will make the doghous cooler becaus white had the least averag heat
28249	10	white becaus more air can get insid the doghous
28250	10	white you would want a lighter color like white so that not as much heat get trap in the doghous cook your dog .
28251	10	dark grai i think the dark grei would effect the dog hous the most becaus it would alwai give the dog shade and it wouldnt be to bright in the morn or the dai that wai the dog could sleep whenev it want .
28252	10	light grai that color would keep the doghous cool but not freez and not so hot that the dog would be pant either . in the result it said that the high temperatur wa 53 deg c and the low wa 4 2 deg c . 53 deg would be veri hot in the summer and 42 deg would be veri cold in the winter . so 45 deg would keep it mostli the same all through out the year .
28253	10	dark grai i chose dark grai becaus in summer it would not be as hot as black and in winter it would not be to cold as white or light grai
28254	10	black i chose thi becaus it got a higher averag than the other hous .
28255	10	black if thei us black it will keep the dog warm in winter and summer . black absorb heat so insid the doghous will be warm if the doghous color wa light grai the averag temperatur would be around 45 deg c but that with ajar and white would be 42 deg c and with black it be 53 deg c so it will be even warmer ina doghous .
28256	10	black it will absorb sunlight and heat up the doghous
28257	10	white white will affect the doghous becaus lighter color dont attract sunlight that much like black doe so white would make the doghous stai cooler .
28258	10	white whit would probabl make the air insid the jar cooler than it would be if i wa back or ani other dark color .
28259	10	white the white pant will not absorb as much heat so insid the doghous will be cooler . as you can see from the data black absorb the most heat with the averag temperatur of 53 deg c while the white paint made the air in the jar rise to an averag of 42 deg c .
28260	10	dark grai i think the best color for the doghous would be dark grai becaus dark grai will not make the air temperatur rais as much as the some of the other color but it also wont make it too cold for the dog . the averag test result for dark grai wa 48 deg c where the black wa at 53 deg c which wa the highest . the lowest wa the white and that wa at 42 deg c . so the dark grai is about in the middl of the highest and lowest result so it should be just about perfect temperatur for the dog .
28261	10	black black would help keep the doghous warm becaus after sit ina jar for ten minut the black lid had the highest averag temperatur .
28262	10	black black paint will affect the doghous becaus when it is hot outsid the insid will be extrem hot . in the data tabl the averag for black paint is 53 deg c compar to the averag of white paint 42 deg c . mean the darker the color the more heat .
28263	10	white if brandi and jerri live ina hotter environ then white would beth best choic for comfort becaus lighter color attract more heat . if it is colder then thei should go with black fort he doghous color becaus black absorb more energi .
28264	10	white it would make the doghous cooler becaus white deflect more heat make it cooler and black attract more heat make it hotter
28265	10	white i think thei should us white for the dog hous becaus the darker the color of the lid in the experi the hotter the air wa in the jar . data for white wa 42 deg and the data for black w as deg so it a signific differ in the temp so thei should us white so the dog wont be as hot in hi doghous .
28266	10	white white is a color that reflect all color so in that case make it cooler and black and dark grei and light grei will attract the sun and other color .
28267	10	white it could effect it by if the color wa dark then it would absorb more energi . if it is light is light then it wont absorb a lot energi .
28268	10	white white becaus white ha the less temperatur so that mean the paint will last longer then have black dark grei or light grei . if you end up have that the paint would last as long as the white paint .
28269	10	white i choos white becaus accord to the data tabl white absorb the least amount of heat compar to the other color lid . also the dog will most like be hot so you want a color that wont make the doghous hot .
28270	10	dark grai paint the doghous dark grai affect the doghous and the dog live it in . with white paint the doghous will have a temperatur of about 42 deg c . with a temperatur of 42 deg c the dog my get too cold but black paint creat a temperatur of about 54 deg c which mai caus the dog to get too warm . dark grai make a temperatur of about 48 deg c that isnt too warm or too cold .
28271	10	dark grai well the color dark grei would help the dog keep warm and not cold in the doghous . and it will also be a nice color and the dog will most like like the doghous if it not too hot for him or to cold .
28272	10	light grai the light grei would make it not too hot but also not to cold so you can cool down easi but not stai to cold like if the sun is shine on a black hous you aunt go to get veri cool in your hous but if it light grei or grei then you have abett chanc of stai cool like mani of the hous in the world that ar light grei
28273	10	black the color black will keep the doghous at ana averag temperatur of 53 deg c which i think thi is a good mild temperatur fora dog . the result also state that the color dark grai light grai and white would result ina 40 deg temper which i believ would be too cold . i think it mai get a bit hotter or colder temperatur insid the doghous becaus of the size differ ina jar but i still believ black would beth best color to paint it .
28274	10	white less heat would go into the doghous if thei chose a white background
28275	10	light grai the light grai will affect the doghous by c hang the light grai color to possibl tow white
28276	10	white us white for the doghous would keep the doghous the coolest temperatur . the black lid made the air temperatur in the jar 53 deg c . the white lid made the air temperatur in the jar 48 deg c . the white lid made the air temperatur of the jar 5 deg c cooler than the black lid .
28277	10	white end
28278	10	dark grai dark grai might affect the doghous becaus it will keep it warm in the winter and cool in the summer becaus it had an in between averag temperatur
28279	10	light grai light grai becaus it wouldnt absorb a lot of energi .
28280	10	black the color might affect the doghous becaus it get hotter .
28281	10	dark grai black might take the doghous too hot becaus in the experi black had an averag temperatur of 53 deg c . white would make the doghous to cold becaus in the ex pi raiment the averag temperatur wa 42 deg c . i chose dark grai becaus it wouldnt be to hot or to cold becaus it had an averag temperatur of 48 deg c .
28282	10	white i would choos white becaus white attract the least amount of heat so the dog would stai nice and cool .
28283	10	light grai when it sunni outsid and the dog is insid hi or her doghous then thei will get some nice heat becaus it is alight grai . if you us white then there wouldnt have been that much heat . and if it wa dark grai or black then it would be too hot .
28284	10	black black would affect the doghous by make it warmer so when it rain the dog can go insid the doghous to get warmer becaus black absorb more light and that can be heat . like in the experi black averag out to beth warmest color and absorb the most light .
28285	10	white the color white will not get as hot as the other color becaus white as wa shown in the tabl wa the least hot
28286	10	white white would beth best color for the dog hous becaus white doesnt absorb as much heat as seen by the comparison of the averag temperatur so the insid of the doghous wont be as hot
28287	10	black black would make the dog hose the hottest .
28288	10	dark grai if the doghous wa paint dark grai then the temperatur insid the hous would be warm . thi is becaus it is a darker tone mean it absorb more heat . if brandi and jerri live ina cooler place thi might help but it also work in warmer situat becaus then there is more heat to absorb versu the cooler place where there is less heat .
28289	10	white the white doe not be in as much heat as the other color .
28290	10	dark grai it will the doghous not the hot and not that cold as well so pretti warm doghous
28291	10	white the lightest color white will beth least warm color in the doghous . thi is support by the experi data . white wa the coldest temp 42 deg c while black wa the hottest 53 deg c
28292	10	white how thi color might effect the doghous is that if doghous is paint black it will heat up more becaus in brandi and jerri s experi the black lid had a averag of 53 deg c . the dark grai had an averag of 48 deg c . white is the best becaus it averag heat wa 42 deg c .
28293	10	light grai i would choos light grai becaus it a happi medium . i will keep the doghous cool while also keep it warm . the averag wa 45 mean the black might be to warm and the white might be to cool .
28294	10	black i chose the color black . thi color can affect the doghous by in the cold time be warm . but in the summer it will get hot most like and that will forc the dog out of hi littl doghous to get some fresh air . in the experi the temperatur for the color black were 53 deg c on averag and that is pretti high compar to the color white temperatur with it be 42 deg c averag . and there is a big advantag if a black doghous becaus when when you have a chilli weather you will have the black absorb sunlight and ani energi that is avail compar to white with absorb bare anyth .
28295	10	dark grai although dark grai can be realli hot dure the summer it wont be that hot dure the winter . thei need to balanc it out . if thei pick white it will be fine for the dog in the summer but the dog would freez dure the winter . if thei pick black the dog would be sweat all the time in the summer but in the winter it wont be super freez like when the white is paint dure the winter .
28296	10	white it wont get as hot as the other color . the white had the coldest averag temperatur at 42 .
28297	10	dark grai so in the summer it not to hotter but in the winter it not to cold . also the long will not have a heatstrok in the summer or freez in the winter . also dark grai can hold in heat realli good . so that why i thing thei should us dark grai for the doghous color .
28298	10	black if you paint it black it will keep the dog hous warmer than if you had paint it white light grai or dark grei
28299	10	white brandi and jerri should paint the doghous white so the dog doesnt get too hot when insid . thei should do thi so that when the sun shine down on the doghous the insid temperatur doesnt get too hot for the dog . the white lid onli got to 42 deg c while the black got to 53 deg c and the dark grai got to 48 deg c and the light grai got to 45 deg c . if you dont want the dog to get too hot then thei should paint the doghous white . also becaus the white lid onli heat up 18 deg c while the black heat up 29 deg c the dark grai 24 deg c and the light grai 21 deg c . thei should paint the doghous white so when the sun shine on the roof it doesnt get too hot insid for the dog .
28300	10	black from the result of the experi black would be a good paint color for the doghous becaus dure the cold season but when there is some sun the dog would be kept the warmest . i know thi becaus of the result of black is 53 deg c and dark grai wa at 48 deg c . so the best color for the doghous would be black .
28301	10	black the paint wont be ask thick as the other . sinc the black paint had the most averag the black paint wa finest which made it easier to paint and didnt smell as bad .
28302	10	black by black be the darkest color it will attract more heat for the doghous . in everi trial black wa at least 4 degre higher in temperatur .
28303	10	dark grai dure the dai the doghous would stai in the 40 s mayb 50 degre so the dog wouldnt be too hot dure the dai and at night it would stai warm from all the heat the color caught dure the dai .
28304	10	white if it is realli hot in the summertim then the dog could cool off in the doghous becaus accord to the experi the color white absorb less heat energi
28305	10	light grai i choos light grai becaus it give the dog hous an averag temperatur of 45 deg c not to hot not to cold
28306	10	light grai light grai would be a good color fora dog hous becaus it let a littl heat in but not as much as dark grei and black k .
28307	10	black thi color might affect the temperatur of the doghous becaus it will beth warmest for the dog becaus the sun black color will soak up the warmth less of the sun and you want the dog to stai warm and not freez to death .
28308	10	dark grai the dark grei would not make the doghous veri hot like the black paint which wa at 53 deg averag but it would not be as cool as the white paint which wa at 42 deg averag .
28309	10	white the insid of the doghous will be cool rather than hot
28310	10	black the best paint color fora doghous would be black . the data tabl show that it increas air temperatur the most so with a black doghous the dog would alwai be warm when it insid of it .
28311	10	white i would suggest to color the doghous white becaus white color doesnt absorb light it just reflect it and the dog would be more happi becaus the color is veri cold look becaus it doesnt absorb light . accord to the data on the experi the averag of the white lid color is 42 deg the black color is 53 deg the dark grai color is 48 deg and the light grai color is 45 deg . so i prefer white color the most
28312	10	white the color white will affect the doghous by cool the insid down therefor make the hous more comfort for the dog . thi is support by the conclus of their test becaus the test show that the white live can averag temperatur wa 42 deg c and the other result were 45 48 and 54 deg c show that the white wa cooler
28313	10	white us white paint for the doghous would beth coolest option for the paint . i think thi becaus the white paint had the lowest temperatur in the jar . on averag the temperatur insid the jar wa onli 42 deg c with the white paint . it wa the lowest temperatur out of the black 53 deg c dark grei 48 deg c and light grei 45 deg c . us the white paint would affect the doghous by keep it much cooler then the other color . so the best option for the paint would be white .
28314	10	black the color might affect the insid of doghous becaus the darker the color more light or heat energi attract . the insid of doghous would be warmer than us a lighter color .
28315	10	black if you paint your doghous black then it will beth warmest . dark color absorb energi wai better than light color do . in the data tabl it sai that for the color black the jar temperatur wa 54 deg 52 deg 54 deg and the averag wa 53 deg . while the color white got 42 deg 43 deg 41 deg and their averag temperatur wa 42 deg . therefor black would beth best color to keep your dog warm .
28316	10	black i think that black might affect the doghous becaus the number awai higher than the other color higher than there st of the number there all in the forti except for black i think all of them would work except for black becaus the number ar higher than the other color and i dont think that you would seeth color at night that is why i think that wouldnt work on the doghous
28317	10	white thi color would make the doghous more cooler then anoth color becaus it is the lightest if you were to make the doghous black it would be realli hot becaus heat attract to black .
28318	10	white it might be to cold in the doghous dure the winter unlik if it wa paint black then it would be warm but white doesnt attract as much heat so be good for summer .
28319	10	white white would beth best paint color becaus it doe not get as warm as the other color . it averag temperatur after 10 minut wa 42 deg c unlik the other color whose temperatur after 10 minut were black 53 deg c dark grai 48 deg c and light grai 45 deg c .
28320	10	dark grai caus it is a dark color but not to dark sot here will be air
28321	10	white the color white becaus in the experi the whitecap got the lowest among of heat so the white will make it less hot for the dog .
28322	10	white the color white would be best for the dog hous becaus it would keep it most cool . i know thi becaus from the experi the result from black were much warmer temperatur than the light color like white . from the result in the tabl you can see that black wa 1 degre warmer than white . so in conclus if you want to keep the dog hous cool it would be best to us white .
28323	10	white it doesnt absorb heat like black and all the other dark color . it would stai cooler in the doghous .
28324	10	white white absorb the least amount of energi in the data so if white were to beth color of the doghous the temperatur insid would overal be lower than if the doghous wa paint a differ color that would absorb more energi .
28325	10	light grai light grai is the best color to paint the doghous becaus it wont attract much heat and it wont be cold so it perfect temperatur fora dog a good temperatur is usual at 45 deg c and the light grai ha an averag of 45 deg c so light grai will beth beast
28326	10	black black absorb more heat therefor that will keep the dog warm .
28327	10	black black would beth best paint color becaus it would keep the insid of a doghous warmer then the other color . thi is better becaus the dog would then be warmer at night then he would be with other color . the data support thi . black got an averag of 53 deg calcium which wa 5 deg degre warmer then the next warmest color dark grai .
28328	10	black the black paint will hold the heat in when it is cold outsid
28329	10	black that color could keep the insid of the dog hous more warm becaus the black sore the sun energi . i alsop pick black becaus the data of lid over the jar show how black affect the temperatur by make it warmer
28330	10	light grai thei should make the doghous light grei be sue it would keep it cool in the summer but warm in the winter
28331	10	light grai thi color would be best becaus it would keep the dog cool off in the summer but also keep it warmer in the winter if it wa ever outsid .
28332	10	black black will affect the doghous by make it hotter becaus in the experi the data show that the color black absorb the most heat .
28333	10	white it gonna effect the temperatur in the dog hous
28334	10	black the black color i chose will make the dog hous warmer for the dig becaus black absorb more energi than the other color . black had an averag of 53 deg c air temperatur insid a glass jar while a white lid on a glass jar had onli 42 deg c . thu make black the better choic becaus it will absorb more energi make the doghous warmer for the dog .
28335	10	dark grai i think dark grai would be a good color becaus the start temperatur wa 24 deg and it not to hot or to cold
28336	10	white white is the color to see at when you look for the dog .
28337	10	white it would make the air insid the doghous cooler make the dog want to be in it instead of outsid .
28338	10	black the color black is a dark color which absorb more energi . mean that the air temperatur would be quit warm and insul . base on the tabl the averag temperatur insid a glass jar with a black lid wa 53 deg c in 10 minut . while a glass jar with a white lid had an averag temperatur of 42 deg c in 10 minut both at a start temperatur of 24 deg c . so the darker the color of the lid on the glass earth higher the temperatur insid it .
28339	10	dark grai it will keep the dog pretti warm but not too hot .
28340	10	black the darker the color the more energi is be absorb . averag temperatur on the black wa 53 deg c which wa the highest and the averag temperatur for white 42 deg c wa lowest
28341	10	white the white color as shown from the data ha an averag lower temperatur than the other color . as dog natur have fur and resent the heat much more than the cold it is more conveni for brandi and jerri assum thei do not have intent of tortur the dog to paint the hous white .
28342	10	black wont be to cold or to hot for the dog to be in
28343	10	black black becaus if the sun is out then it will collect more energi then anoth color caus it darker
28344	10	light grai light grai becaus dark color ar shown to absorb more heat caus it to be hotter insid the doghous and light color dont absorb as much heat so make the doghous roof light grai should make the doghous heat wise better for the dog .
28345	10	light grai i chose light grai becaus you want your dog to be warm but not hot or cold . the doghous will absorb energi but not a lot it is enough energi to keep your dog safe from be too hot and too cold .
28346	10	dark grai i chose black becaus the averag data for black is 53 deg and i believ that temperatur is enough to keep a dog warm but not extrem hot where the dog would want to stai outsid of it
28347	10	black i chose black becaus black got hotter in ten minut than all the other color . also the color black absorb more heat .
28348	10	light grai the insid of the doghous wont be too cold or too hot . as the color is more dark the more hot it will be insid the doghous . the averag for the color black after 10 minut wa 53 deg c . the averag for the color white after 10 minut wa 42 deg c .
28349	10	black black becaus instead of reflect the us rai off the doghous the us rai ar absorb .
28350	10	white white would be the best color for the doghous becaus it stai at a constant 42 deg when black stai at a constant 53 deg
28351	10	white it would keep the hous cooler then the other color would
28352	10	white the color white will keep the doghous cool for the dog . ani of the darker color would heat up the doghous and the dog will be miser .
28353	10	light grai i think thei should paint the doghous a light grai so that it can catch a littl bit of heat but not to much so that the insid is extrem warm . i think if the choos the light grai the insid of the doghous wont fall apart as fast as it would if thei paint it a darker color such as black .
28354	10	light grai the best color to paint the doghous is light grai . if the hous is alight frai then the doghous will stai at ana averag of 45 degre calcium therefor the doghous wont be too warm or too cold .
28355	10	dark grai the doghous might get to hot if you pant it black but it might get to cold if you pant it white . the averag of black 53 and white 42 .
28356	10	light grai light grai would be a good choic becaus it not too cold and not too hot . it would make the insid of the doghous perfect temperatur . the averag for dark grai is 48 deg c and light grai is 45 deg c . therefor light grai would be abett color for the doghous .
28357	10	dark grai i chose dark grai becaus the color affect the insid of the doghous by the heat the dog wont be as hot or cold in the the hous and he will have the right temperatur becaus the temperatur is 48 and the averag is 48 .
28358	10	white the color white will be a realli nice color becaus the averag of the white lid wa the lowest of all 4 color .
28359	10	white i think thei should us white becaus in winter thei could bring the dog insid and plu dog have fur to keep them warm . plu in the summer thei cant shave off theyr fur all by themselv so have a white doghous that absorb less heat will keep the dog cooler .
28360	10	white white might affect the doghous becaus it wont have that much energi or air for the dog to breath
28361	10	white if you were go to build a doghous with a white roof then it would be much cooler then a doghous with a darker c color roof . if you were go to build a white doghous then you would need to live ina veri hot area so the dog dose not freez . the averag them natur fora black roof wa 53 deg c . the averag temperatur fora white doghous is 42 deg c . there for there would be a 11 deg c temperatur chang between the two color .
28362	10	light grai light grai is a good color for the doghous becaus you dont want the doghous be so dark ora nasti look color .
28363	10	light grai in the summer month it wouldnt get to hot . in the winter month it would be enough to keep the dog warm .
28364	10	white white would beth best color to do . i know thi becaus dark color or shade absorb heat so you dont want the dog to die from heat .
28365	10	dark grai i chose dark grai . it would be a good color becaus if it cold outsid the dark grai would absorb more of the sun heat and energi than the light grai and white . if it wa outsid it would absorb less heat and energi from the sun than the black would .
28366	10	white if thei choos thi color then the insid of the doghous will be kept cool base on their result .
28367	10	white white will make the insid cooler than if it wa black becaus the darker the color the hotter it will be .
28368	10	light grai becaus the doghous ha hot air insid so i choos light grai .
28369	10	white the best color to paint the doghous would be white becaus the white doghous would absorb less light make the doghous color so that the dog would not overheat .
28370	10	light grai the color will make the doghous cooler than black or dark grei would but it would still be warmer than just plain white . in the diagram the differ in temperatur is shown . with a black roof the doghous would be 52 deg c . meanwhil the light grei roof would averag at 45 deg c which is probabl better for the dog .
28371	10	dark grai i think dark grai would beth best color for the doghous becaus the darker the color is the greater increas of the air temperatur insid the doghous . the doghous need to be warm and c oz for the dog . i didnt choos black becaus it would be to warm in the doghous for him the dog alreadi ha fur to keep him warm si dark grai would probabl beth best for him .
28372	10	white a white doghous would make the insid cooler . in the experi a whitecap on ajar made a cooler jar insid than a black cap which made a warmer insid .
28373	10	light grai light grai might affect the insid of the dog hous by make it warmer in cold weather but not to hot in warm weather . temperatur from the black lid and dark grai would be to hot at a averag temperatur of 53 deg for black and 48 for dark grai . and if the paint were white it could be to cold at a averag temperatur of 42 deg . light grai with a averag of 45 deg would be 8 deg cooler than black 3 deg cooler than dark grai and 3 deg warmer than white .
28374	10	white the color white can effect the doghous becaus in the summer the doghous can give the dog shade to cool down and in the experi it show that white contain the least amount of heat . the color white onli got up to 43 deg c while black got up to 54 deg c .
28375	10	white i choos white becaus it not a dark color and dark color attract heat and bright color doesnt well at least i think so i hope im right
28376	10	light grai i said dark grei it will keep some heat in but will not be realli hot
28377	10	white i would us the white paint for the doghous becaus the lighter the color the cooler the temperatur is . in the experi the white lid on the jar had the lowest averag temperatur of 42 degre while the black lid jar had an averag of 52 degre .
28378	10	black it would make the doghous hotter insid becaus it highest in the experi wa 54 and everi other color wa 48 to beth closest .
28379	10	dark grai dude
28380	10	white the color white will affect the temperatur in the doghous becaus white absorb least energi becaus it is a brighter color . for exampl in the experi the white color had the least averag air temperatur . the averag temperatur wa 42 degre calcium . the averag temperatur for the darker color wa greater . for exampl the color black had an averag air temperatur of 53 degre celsiu .
28381	10	dark grai dark grai is the more suitabl color becaus insid the doghous it would be a constant temperatur of 48 deg c and more comfort for the dog .
28382	10	white i chose the color white becaus it will make the doghous less hot becaus the color white doesnt absorb as much heat as the other three color . in the other experi the first trial black wa 54 deg c dark grai wa 48 deg c light grai wa 44 deg c and final white wa 42 deg c
28383	10	black the black color will absorb most of the heat
28384	10	white it will keep it cooler becaus light color dont absorb as much energi as dark color
28385	10	white the color white could effect the doghous becaus on a hot dai it could get too hot for their dog and could get exhaust and thi wai it wont get too hot and mayb increas the chanc oft he dog to have more energi .
28386	10	white i think white is the best answer to thi question . becaus darker color absorb heat as much heat as possibl but white doesnt absorb as much heat becaus it isnt as dark as black dark grei and light grei . thi color will keep it cap ina doghous .
28387	10	black darker color absorb more light . if thei us black then in winter it will be a littl warmer .
28388	10	dark grai the dark grai color would beth best becaus the doghous would have to be cool and warm enough fort he dog to be in it . the dark grai color absorb the right amount of light energi and keep it balanc .
28389	10	white it will make so then it is not as hot in the doghous becaus in the experi the white temperatur wa the lowest out of them all .
28390	10	white in the summer you would want to paint your doghous white so it doesnt get so hot in there . the color white is ana averag 5 deg cooler than the color black .
28391	10	light grai i think thei should us alight grai paint becaus the insid of the doghous would becom a alright temperatur for the dog and it is better than black or dark grei becaus those color would make the insid of the doghous to hot fora dog . see how the result were the light grei would be around 45 deg c and ani below or abov that would have a air temperatur that too hot or cold . if it wa summer the energi from the sun heat in the doghous would be cooler becaus the color wa lighter .
28392	10	black the color black might affect the doghous becaus it wa proven that the color black increas the temperatur . so if you choos the color black it will affect the doghous by increas the temperatur to keep the dog warm .
28393	10	light grai thi might affect the doghous by keep the dog warm in the winter but not realli cold . sinc thei have fur the dog hous doesnt need to be warm on the motherland in the peak of summer the dog would need a chill pace to get out of the sun . so the light grei would keep the dog warm in winter and cold in the summer .
28394	10	black it affect the doghous becaus the darker the color the more increas in air temperatur .
28395	10	black black would beth best color becaus accord g to the graph the darker the color black wa 53 c the hotter the surfac and the lighter the color white wa 42 c the cooler the temperatur .
28396	10	white the white color is not the hottest on but when it is a hot dai you want the doghous to be cool as possibl . if you want to get warm you go outsid . becaus the chang between the start temperatur is less thi mai mean that the doghous absorb less of the heat . if it is a cold dai i think that the white doghous will stai a more ideal temperatur all dai than a darker color doghous .
28397	10	dark grai dark grai would give an averag temperatur of 48 deg c . thi temperatur would not be to hot for the dog nor would it be to cold .
28398	10	white the color of the doghous should be white becaus it doesnt absorb as much heat as a black doghous . in the experi the averag temperatur of the glass with a black lid wa 53 deg c after ten minut with a lamp over it . the averag temperatur of the glass with a white lid wa 42 deg c after ten minut with a lamp over it . sinc 53 deg c is greater then 42 deg c the white lid take in less heat .
28399	10	black it will keep the dog warm while it outsid
28400	10	white thi color would affect the doghous by it be colder in the doghous then the other color would make it becaus from the experi it said that white wa a 42 deg c .
28401	10	white paint a doghous white would keep a dog cool wherea paint the hous black would increas the air temperatur and caus the dog to be hot becaus darker color absorb more energi . after 10 minut under the lamp the white lid averag temperatur wa 42 deg c . in comparison the black lid averag temperatur in 10 minut wa 53 deg c . therefor paint a doghous white or ani light color for that matter wind down to a happi owner and a happi dog accord to the result from the experi .
28402	10	white i would chose white becaus white wont attract that much heat and it will keep the insid cooler . but if it were black than it would make it all hot .
28403	10	black the result of the experi show that black wa abl to absorb the most heat see that it averag wa 53 degre . while white got an averag of 42 degre . thi mean that there will be plenti more heat insid the doghous than with ani other color on ani c old dai .
28404	10	light grai i think thei should have the doghous paint light grai becaus in the experi the air insid at averag wa 45 deg c and white wa a littl to cold 42 deg c and black would make it to hot 53 deg c . light grai would beth safest fora dog so it doesnt get to hot nor cold .
28405	10	light grai light grai mai effect the dog hous ina good wai becaus it daylight it will be bright then at night it will be dark enough instead of bright white .
28406	10	dark grai the dark grei wouldnt be hot like an averag of 53 deg it would be somewher in the middl like 48 deg .
28407	10	white it would make it cooler indirect sunlight
28408	10	black black becaus the darker the doghous the greater the increas in air temperatur insid the doghous
28409	10	white white becaus light color dont get as much energi from the sun as the dark color do . and look back at there experi the white paint had the less energi the result where 42 deg 43 deg 41 deg and lastli wa 42 deg .
28410	10	black it will make the insid of the doghous hotter by the color black becaus the sun is attract by the color
28411	10	white thi color might affect the doghous becaus sinc it ha the lowest averag of temperatur it would be good for your dog so it doe not get to hot in the doghous . the temperatur of the white lid jar is 42 deg c for the light grai it is 45 deg c for the dark grai it is 48 deg c and for the black it is 53 deg c . that show that the white lid jar ha the lowest temp and is the best choic for the doghous .
28412	10	black pen due es
28413	10	white brandi and jerri should us white paint color becaus in the experi it show that a dark color like black absorb lot of heat from the sun . if you us a dark color it get to much heat from the sun and then insid the doghous it would be hot . the dog alreadi ha it fur to keep it warm so i dont think the dog would like it to be ani hotter .
28414	10	white the white will reflect sunlight leav the insid of the doghous cooler . i know thi becaus when a white lid wa us in the experi the jar wa 42 deg c . light grai wa 45 deg c on averag dark grai wa 48 deg c and black wa 53 deg c .
28415	10	dark grai dark grai would make the doghous warmer but not as hot as black . sinc the air in the jar with the black lid wa warmest at aug . of 53 deg c and dark grai wa next warmest at a aug . of 48 deg c it would keep the doghous ina in between temp natur . not to hot not to cold .
28416	10	black blackwel affect the doghous by keep it warm . darker color absorb more energi .
28417	10	white white would beth best color fora doghous becaus dog can easili overheat especi in summer so the lower you can possibl keep the temperatur the better .
28418	10	dark grai if you put dark color .
28419	10	white it would shine and the dog would see it hous but it can get muddi earli an fast .
28420	10	dark grai dark grei would beth best becaus the temp wa the second highest so when it cold outsid the doghous will still get some heat but when it hot out the dog wont die of heatstrok .
28421	10	white paint the doghous white would affect the temperatur insid the doghous becaus white retel light while black absorb light . the white lid cover wa 11 degre cooler than the black . unless thei want their dog to die of overh thei should paint the hous white .
28422	10	light grai i chose thi color becaus it took on less heat than ani other lid except for the white lid . it also wa warm enough in ten minuet of time that it would be about 70 deg c dure middai . the temperatur would keep the dog warm in the winter and cool in the summer .
28423	10	light grai i chose light grai so that the doghous wont be to hot from the black or the dark grai . i didnt pick the white so that the doghous wont be to cold for the dog .
28424	10	light grai thi color might affect the doghous by the temperatur . light grei is best choic for the doghous becaus you dont want the dog to be too hot or too cold in the doghous . darker color absorb heat better base on the experi becaus the darkest color had the hottest jar which it temperatur wa 53 deg c and the lightest color had the coldest jar which wa 42 deg c so i chose the color that is right in between the other darker and lighter color .
28425	10	dark grai if thei give the dog a dark grei doghous the dog wont die of heat in the summer if you give it a water bowl and in the winter he will beat a comfi heat
28426	10	dark grai i chose the color dark grei becaus st of all thi color wa on the upper side of the data mean it absorb more energi leav the space with a higher air temperatur . it absorb energi like black but it doesnt absorb as much . it make it warm enough forth e winter and cool enough for the summer . the data state the averag air temperatur for the jar with a dark grei lid wa 48 deg c which would be fine for an anim consid thei have fur .
28427	10	dark grai dark grai will keep the dog warm in the winter and cool in the summer becaus it doesnt attract too much heat but just enough to stai warm .
28428	10	black the dark color absorb more energi .
28429	10	light grai so the doghous wont be to bright or too dark .
28430	10	brandi and jerri should paint the doghous white if thei want the doghous to stai cool becaus the white lid had the lowest temperatur with an averag of 42 deg c . if brandi and jerri want the doghous to stai warm thei should paint it black becaus the black lid had the warmest temperatur with an averag of 53 deg c . if thei want the doghous to be warm and cool thei should desir weather thei want it to be slightli warmer or slight cooler . if thei want it to be slightli warmer thei should paint the doghous dark grai the yard grai lid it had the second warmest temperatur with an averag of 48 deg c . if brandi and jerri would like the doghous slightli cooler thei should paint it light grai the light grai lid had the second coolest temperatur with an averag of 45 deg c . it all depend on how warm or cool thei want the dog hous to be .
28431	10	light grai the color light grai is the best color for the doghous becaus black is to warm averag temp . 53 deg c dark grai is warm too averag temp . 48 deg c white is to cold averag temp . 48 deg c and light grai is not to cold averag temp . 45 deg c and is not to hot for the dog .
28432	10	white i think white is the best color becaus in the dada it sai that the temperatur of the jar wa 41 43 deg c therefor it wont be so hot insid the doghous
28433	10	black the best color would be black becaus sinc the darker color absorb more heat then it will keep the insid warm for the dog
28434	10	white it doesnt absorb as much heat . the averag te murat for the white wa 42 deg c
28435	10	white the color white would make the doghous cooler less hot insid than the other color . that statement is support by their experi in the follow wai . the averag temperatur for all the color wa black 53 deg dark grai 48 deg light grai 45 deg and white 42 deg . that show that the averag temp futur for white is lower than ani of those other color
28436	10	dark grai for dark grai to be in the glass jar for 10 minut i pick that color becaus it the same trial over and over again but also becaus of the averag .
28437	10	dark grai dark grai would affect the doghous by make it warm but not to hot insid . i know thi becaus the averag temp . after 10 min . wa 48 deg c . unlik the black whom wa at 53 deg c with the highest temp . and white at 42 deg c with the lowest temp .
28438	10	white thi color would keep the doghous cooler for the dog .
28439	10	light grai brandi and jerri should us the light grai paint for the doghous becaus in the experi with the light grai tempi true wa in the middl it wasnt to hot and it wasnt to cold it wa onli between 44 deg f and 46 deg f so it will beth perfect tempi true insid the doghous in the summer and in the winter .
28440	10	white the doghous will be cooler for the dog in the summer when the dog is spend time outsid .
28441	10	black depend on the area that you live in i think that black would beth best color for the doghous . the reason i sai thi is becaus that the color black dure the experi absorb the most heat with an averag of 53 deg f over the dark grei averag of 48 deg flight grei 45 deg f and also the white averag of 42 deg f . the highest averag temperatur of the black paint would allow the dog to keep warmer dure the cooler season of the year such as winter fall and even spring in some area .
28442	10	white the color white might affect the doghous becaus darker color trap light so a lighter color will keep the doghous cooler than if it wa a darker color .
28443	10	light grai thi color will keep the doghous warm insid but not to hot .
28444	10	light grai it will repel most heat as to keep the doghous cool in the summer but it ha a small amount of heat attract so that if the dog is outsid in the winter he can get a littl heat .
28445	10	white it will stop heat concentr on the dog hous and cool the doghous .
28446	10	dark grai the lighter the color the less energi it absorb . dark grai will be warm in the cold but cold in the heat .
28447	10	black for the doghous i would us black . i would chose thi color becaus the color would absorb more heat and warm the doghous more . in thi experi black had an averag temperatur of 53 deg while white had an averag temp of 42 deg
28448	10	dark grai dark grai is a good color becaus it effect toward the heat will keep it a good temperatur . it isnt as hot as black which averag out to 53 deg c and it wont be as cold as the white which averag out to 42 deg c .
28449	10	dark grai the color will affect the doghous by get warm
28450	10	black when it is cold and the dog ha to sleep outsid black attract the sun more and the dog will be warmer
28451	10	white the best paint for the doghous would be white becaus it will keep the hous at a nice temperatur becaus if the hous temperatur would be black then we could predict that the temperatur insid the hous would be about 53 deg c so if the color wa white then we could predict base on the experi that the temperatur would be about 42 deg c .
28452	10	black if thei paint the doghous black it would make the doghous warmer then the other color becaus in the experi black wa the hottest averag point .
28453	10	white it affect the doghous becaus then the dog us wont absorb ani non need temperatur in the summertim .
28454	10	white i would choos a white color becaus it doesnt absorb much heat from the sun . black absorb more heat becaus in the tabl it show that the water in the black lid had a greater amount thant he other color there were . so white would beth better choic . the doghous would have cooler air .
28455	10	black the darker color will absorb more energi so there will be more heat
28456	10	white in the experi the black and darker color lid were the on with the hottest temperatur so white is the best
28457	10	black dark grai
28458	10	white i chose white becaus the darker the color the hotter the air temperatur is . white is the lightest color and would therefor reflect the light instead of absorb it .
28459	10	white us white for the color of the doghous would keep the insid of the doghous cooler becaus in the experi the white lid color stai coolest under the lamp .
28460	10	black the darker the color the more light the dog hous will get .
28461	10	white i think thei should pan the dog hous white becaus in the experi the jar with the white lid had the coolest air temperatur so if you paint the doghous white it would stai cooler in the dai so the dog wouldnt overheat
28462	10	white thi color will make the doghous be colder than all of the other color the temperatur for it wa 42 deg and the other were higher than that
28463	10	light grai it would not get hot enough in the summer to overheat and kill the dog but it is unlik in the winter it will die from the cold .
28464	10	white the doghous will stai cooler in the summer time when it is hot .
28465	10	white out of all the color that were us in thi experi white had the lowest deg c . the jar with the black lid had 53 deg c but the dark grai onli had 48 deg c as for the light grai that had 45 deg c and final white had onli 42 deg c . thi data show that the white doghous would beth best choic sinc dog have fur to keep them warm but in the summer it would be hot thei would need a hous that could keep them cool but if the person want a hous for the dog that would keep the dog warm but not to hot and cool but not to cool thei would need to pick between the dark grai and the light grai color sinc those color keep around the same temperatur .
28466	10	black it might make it hot in the dog have
28467	10	black the best color so keep your dog warm and not cold is black it contain more heat and it sore a lot of the heat out side of it
28468	10	black black will affect the doghous becaus it absorb more light and an the heat of the doghous will increas becaus the black jar averag temperatur wa 53 deg c and the coolest jar white jar had an averag of 42 deg c . the black jar wa 11 . 25 deg c hotter then the white .
28469	10	light grai i think thei should us light grai paint . the light grai paint would help keep in some other heat but not all of it . in the experi the darkest color lid black kept a temperatur of 5 3 deg c on averag . the lightest color white kept an averag temperatur of 42 deg c . thi show the darker the color the higher the temperatur . the lighter the color the lower the temperatur .
28470	10	white i think the best color fora doghous would be white as it keep the dog hous at a pleasantli cool temperatur protect the dog from excess heat . the evid to backup thi assumpt is shown in the data tabl as the white be the color that kept the doghous the coolest .
28471	10	white the insid of the doghous will be cooler becaus the heat is go to reflect off the sun . with white the air temp wa onli 42 deg but with black the air temp wa 54 deg
28472	10	dark grai thi color mai affect the doghous becaus it is said that black attract heat and white reflect heat if the doghous is dark grai then it might take in heat dure the summer while the dog is outplai and then keep the dog warm at night while sleep but it could also retract some heat so it wont make the dog too hot becaus it not all the wai black .
28473	10	light grai if thei paint the doghous light grai it wouldnt be too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter .
28474	10	light grai the doghous will stai cool but not to cold and not to hot .
28475	10	black the color black would affect the doghous becaus the darker color will bring more heat to the doghous so the dog hous will be warmer .
28476	10	white white might effect the doghous becaus . . it will get dirti easier insid and out
28477	10	white thi color is bright and reflect the sun rai . it had an averag of 42 deg c while black had 53 deg c as an averag . thi make the insid of the doghous cooler .
28478	10	black the color black will affect the doghous becaus the darker the color the more warmer it will be on the insid accord to the experi that brandi and jerri did unlik white the color white would make it more cool
28479	10	white the best color to paint the doghous would be white becaus the white wouldn t make the insid of the doghous ash o . in trial on of the black lid the temperatur of the insid of the jar wa 54 deg c . in the first trial of the white lid the temperatur of the insid of the jar wa 42 deg c .
28480	10	white it would probabl make it cooler insid the dog hous when the sun reflect on it . . . if it were darker it would attract more heat energi and make the doghous warmer insid . so i would paint it white becaus it would attract heat but no in the insid .
28481	10	dark grai well sinc dark color attract more heat the dog would be warm in hi or her doggi hous . if i would of chosen black the dog might be to hot and not realli want to come insid it .
28482	10	black if brandi and jerri paint the doghous black then the insid of the doghous would be warmer becaus after 10 minut under the lamp the averag temperatur for the black lid wa 53 deg c when the other color were in the 40 s rang .
28483	10	black how black might effect the doghous is it would stai warm insid becaus ani dark color the sun is attract to it .
28484	10	light grai well would choos light grai becaus it would keep the dog warm if it wa cold out . and if it wa wa hot out the dog would not get to cold and not to hot .
28485	10	white how thi color will affect the insid of the doghous will be by keep it cool becaus in the hypothesi it aid that darker the color greater increas in the air temperatur .
28486	10	black i chose black for the doghous becaus that wai the dog will stai warm . i sai thi becaus in the experi the averag for the black lid wa at 53 deg which wa the greatest temperatur out of the 4 color .
28487	10	black if thei paint the doghous black then the doghous would be warmer insid becaus in the experi black wa the color that absorb the most heat becaus the temperatur in the jar wa the warmest .
28488	10	dark grai war grai would beth best becaus it right in the middl it would be warm in colder whether and cool in hotter whether make the dog as comfi as possibl . hot cool . cold warm
28489	10	white if the doghous wa paint white the air temperatur insid the doghous would be a lot cooler than if it were paint a darker color . in the experi the averag temperatur for the jar with the white lid wa 42 deg . for the light grai it wa 45 deg for the dark grai it wa 48 deg and for the black it wa 53 deg . the jar with the white lid had the lowest averag temperatur .
28490	10	white thi color would make the doghous the least hot out of the other color
28491	10	black black absorb the most heat
28492	10	black thei should paint it black becaus the jar with the black lid had the highest air temperatur . so if the doghous is black then the air temperatur insid the doghous will be fairli warm . so in the winter the dog will still be warm becaus the dark color attract heat .
28493	10	black black will affect the insid becaus it will make it dark insid of it . if it wa white it wouldnt be s dark . if it wa dark grei it would be dark but not as dark and if it wa light grei it would be lighter then the black and dark grei .
28494	10	white white becaus it doe not heat up as much . but if thei live ina cold region then thei might want to paint it black becaus it warm the air temp around it . but thei would probabl let the dog stai in she for the winter so white would be good . also if it now brandi and jerri wouldnt be abl to seeth doghous becaus it is white . also white becom less clean overtim there for thei should pick a color that suit there region not if it is warmer or colder . becaus those thing can be control unlik snow pattern and rain and mud .
28495	10	light grai i pick light grai becaus it a color that would absorb heat and also reflect it . i think thi becaus the temperatur s stai abov 43 deg c and but also stai below 48 deg c
28496	10	white the color will affect the dog hous by be cool down for the dog togo when it sunni
28497	10	dark grai dark grai is the best color for the doghous becaus the temperatur isnt too high it 48 deg for each trial . and the other color temperatur go up and down for each trial .
28498	10	white if you paint the doghous white the tempt ar in the doghous would be less becaus darker color attract more heat . have white paint would be better for the dog becaus he will be c color in hi doghous but if the doghous wa a darker color such as black or dark grei the dog would be a lot warmer . the data show that the averag deg c for black paint wa 53 deg and the averag deg c fort he white paint wa 42 deg . the white hous wa sunni final cooler with a differ between the two temperatur of 11 deg c which would make the doghous a lot better for the dog .
28499	10	dark grai i think thei should us dark grai becaus the dog need warmth and the dark grai provid 48 deg which is pretti warm fora dog
28500	10	dark grai i think that the dark grai is the best choic becaus it stai at a constant degre of 84 degre . the whole time and that good becaus the dog will alwai beat the same temperatur . and i dont like the hous to be differ temperatur so i think that the dog wont either .
28501	10	light grai that color light grai will not absorb too much heat from the sun keep the doghous cooler . but it also absorb minim heat sinc it isnt pure white .
28502	10	white white will absorb the least amount of heat . it will be nice and cool insid the doghous . on averag white got the smallest amount of heat insid the jar at 42 deg c .
28503	10	white it will keep the hous cool .
28504	10	white it will make it cooler becaus it a lighter color .
28505	10	white it will make it less hot for the dog sinc white attract less heat .
28506	10	black if the doghous is paint black it will be warmer for the dog becaus it collect the light . it will be about 10 deg warmer for the dog then us the white paint . in trial 1 the doghous wa 12 deg warmer then the white doghous and 10 deg warmer then the light grai doghous . in the dark grai doghous it wa 48 deg which wa 6 deg cooler then the black doghous .
28507	10	white white would be best caus in the summer white wont get the insid of the doghous to be too hot for the dog but black will make the doghous extrem hot
28508	10	white their go to want to us white becaus it how that the white averag wa 42 compar to black the darkest color averag wa 53 .
28509	10	light grai light grai wont allow the dog to overheat while in it but it also wont allow the dog to get too cold . thi is becaus the grai part of light grai sore sun while the white part deflect it .
28510	10	light grai it will make it so the doghous doesnt get on hot or to cold .
28511	10	black the best color for the doghous is black cob se black got the best averag
28512	10	white white will keep the light out of the dog hous and it is alight color . it will not get the doghous to hot . the white will absorb less heat from the sun . black wa in the 50 deg dark grei wa in the high 40 deg light grei wa in the mid 40 deg and whit wa in the low 40 deg which make it the coolest color to paint ado g hous .
28513	10	dark grai i chose dark grai becaus the darker the color the more heat it hold . if you paint the doghous black it could hold to much heat in the summer and if you paint it white it wont have enough heat in the winter .
28514	10	white if you us white then the doghous will be cooler becaus the averag heat wa the lowest with 42 deg
28515	10	light grai i think light grai becaus so that wai the dog insid wont be so hot and it will alwai be warm insid for the dog the dog wont ever be to hot or to cold .
28516	10	white white will allow the doghous to be cooler than a black on becaus it reflect light . light includ sunlight as welland black absorb light more so white would work . in the experi the black lid caus thea ir temperatur to rise to an averag of 53 deg c . the white lid howev caus the air temperatur to rise to an averag of 42 deg c .
28517	10	light grai the color will affect it becaus in the winter it will be warm enough for the dog so it wont get sick and it will be cool enough in the summer for the dog in the doghous .
28518	10	white white will effect the doghous by not make it hot for the dog becaus you dont want your dog to be hot at night . and i sai thi becaus in the scenario it sai that darker color attract more energi and the graph show that white is less hot than black
28519	10	black a black lid will make the insid of the doghous warmer then ani of the other lid . it will be warmer becaus the darker the color the warmer the object will get . i know thi becaus i averag out the trial and the averag were white 42 light grai 45 dark grai 48 black 53 therefor the black lid wa the darkest color and it wa the warmest and the white wa the lightest color and it wa the coolest .
28520	10	black the temperatur will affect the doghous .
28521	10	light grai i believ that thei should paint the doghous right grai so that while the doghous stai cool it mai also be semi warm see how darker color soak up more energi from the sun . in the experi the black lid wa the hottest and the white the coldest . due to these result it is best togo with a more in between color so that the temperatur mai even out .
28522	10	white if thei paint the doghous white it would caus the lowest intern temperatur of the doghous . on averag the jar with the white lid reach 42 deg c after 10 minut while the jar with the black lid reach on averag 53 deg c after 10 minut . that is a differ of 11 degre therefor white would beth best choic .
28523	10	black black might effect the doghous ina wai where the temperatur might be warmer sinc in the experi the black color had an averag of 53 deg and white had an averag of 42 deg . so if you paint the doghous black it will be warmer .
28524	10	black black will make the doghous have the most heat insid to keep the dog warm dure cold dai . when a black lid wa place over a glass jar it averag the highest air temperatur with 53 deg c . dark grai averag 48 deg c light grai averag 45 deg c and white averag 42 deg c . black ha the most heat to keep dog warm dure cold dai .
28525	10	white i would sai the white hous becaus the white hous is much cooler than the other color becaus it isnt to cold or to hot it the the right temperatur .
28526	10	dark grai dark grei would be best for the doghous becaus you wouldnt want your dog to be to hot or too cold at night and dark grai keep the right temperatur . becaus it averag temperatur is 48 deg c
28527	10	black the color will effect the heat insid the doghous . black will make it warmer and white will make it cooler . the darker the doghous the hotter it will be . if you want a hot doghous black is the best if you want a cool doghous white would be abett color choic .
28528	10	dark grai when it is too hot the dog can go in the lighter color doghous to have a littl cooler temperatur . when it is cold he can go insid to warm up if there is sun .
28529	10	white becaus white is the lightest color it willa absorb the least amount of energi so the air temperatur will be the coolest . for exampl the averag temp . for the darkest color black wa 53 deg while the averag for the lightest color white 42 deg . in conclus in order to have the coolest doghous thei need to paint it white .
28530	10	black becaus at night the dog wouldnt be abl to see it becaus it would be dark out .
28531	10	dark grai it dark grai becaus the darker the lid is the grater it increas in air temperatur in the doghous darker color absorb more energi .
28532	10	black becaus black ha the most air temp . then ani other color
28533	10	white white would affect the doghous becaus white reflect all color so it would colder in the doghous make it more comfort for the dog .
28534	10	light grai the light grai paint would keep the doghous at a just right temperatur . the black and dark grai paint would be do hot their averag temperatur in the jar be 53 deg c and 48 deg c . the white paint would make the doghous to cold it averag temperatur in the jar be 42 deg c . so the light grai would make the doghous the perfect temperatur for the dog it temperatur be a nice 45 deg c .
28535	10	dark grai the color dark grai would beth best becaus it effect the doghous by attract heat to the doghous . how i know thi is the temperatur for the glass jar with the dark grai lid were 48 48 48 and 48 make the doghous about the same temperatur .
28536	10	light grai i think light grei . just becaus it easili in the middl of the temperatur . not too hot and also not too cold .
28537	10	white white doesnt attract heat like the color black doe
28538	10	black if brandi amp jerri live ina veri cold place a black doghous would be a good home for the dog . accord to their experi the darker color absorb more heat than the lighter color . the black lid made the air in the jar have an averag temperatur more than 11 deg c warmer than the white lid . if thei live ina veri warm area thei should paint it white to keep the dog cool .
28539	10	white it will affect the doghous becaus the darker the color the hotter it get so the lighter the cooler the less hot it is that is why white is the best color for the doghous .
28540	10	white if the doghous is paint white then inca e it ever get realli hot outsid their dog wont get too hot while he insid it .
28541	10	white i chose white becaus in the graph it sai the averag is and the other ar 53 48 45 so white is the coolest color .
28542	10	black black becaus it is the warmest c deg color so in the winter your dog will not freez to death becaus it warmer then white dark grei and light grei .
28543	10	white the color white would effect the doghous by make it cooler insid caus in the data it show that the color white had the lowest temperatur out of the other 3 color
28544	10	black black becaus the sun is attract to darker color to make them light
28545	10	white i would paint it white becaus it wouldnt be to hot or cold for the dog it would be just right
28546	10	black white is the best color for the doghous becaus it would keep the doghous the coldest . the averag temperatur for the white jar wa 42 deg c the light grai jar averag temperatur wa 45 deg c the dark grai jar averag wa 48 deg c and the black jar averag wa 53 deg c . even though all of the jar temperatur increas the white jar stai the coolest .
28547	10	white wouldnt be as hot for the dog compar to ani darker color i know thi from the experi thei did
28548	10	black it might affect it by caus it black and mayb that dog and the famili dont realli want black for thereof hous that s mayb why that thei just dont like or dislik that color
28549	10	white you would want to us white becaus in the experi a white lid kept the insid of the jar the coolest which mean it would beth best fora doghous that wai the dog wouldnt get to hot .
28550	10	white the doghous might get warm insid on a hot sunni dai
28551	10	black if thei were to choos black for there dog hous color it will attract more sunlight compar to the other color shown in there data tabl . thi might affect the comfort zone of the dog especi in the summer becaus the sun will be more attract to the color black make it to warm in the doghous .
28552	10	white thi color will not absorb much heat dure the summer so the dog wont get as thirsti .
28553	10	dark grai dark grai would beth best color for the roof of a doghous becaus it will keep the doghous cool in the hotter month and warm in the colder month . the temperatur never realli chang with that color so it will probabl beth best for the dog consid it ha it fur coat too .
28554	10	light grai the light grai color i chose will not make the hous too hot but it will stai warm dure the summer and the winter . i know thi becaus on the experi the jar wa onli about 45 deg c . which will be perfect for the dog .
28555	10	white if the paint color is white then it will keep the doghous cooler becaus from the result of the experi it state that white ha the coolest temperatur with 42 deg c
28556	10	white the white color would effect the doghous by not attract that much of light . i sai thi becaus in the experi the white had less heat attract to the jar the highest it when wa about 43 deg c
28557	10	light grai brandi and jerri should us light grai becaus the averag temperatur wa 45 degre celsiu . a dog ha a lot of fur so the temperatur shouldnt bee too warm but also not too cold .
28558	10	white with white paint as oppos to grai of black there will be less heat in the insid of the doghous . it will be colder . as brandi and jerri saw in the experi the jar with white paint wa on averag 11 degre colder than the jar with a black lid . light grai wa three degre warmer and dark grei wa six degre warmer . so it is logic to conclud that a white roof doghous is the best option especi if thei plan to put the doghous ina place that it will get hot . if the doghous is somewher veri cold howev such as siberia . then it would be more benefici to have adar her roof .
28559	10	white usual you will not want the dog to attract heat in the summer so it would be white and in the winter you might want it to be black so it doe attract heat
28560	10	black you might get abett color becaus the averag of black wa 53 deg
28561	10	white the color might affect the doghous by keep it cooler when the sun it shine on it . thi will keep the dog more c comfort .
28562	10	dark grai the temp . wouldnt be too high or too low . dure the summer the dog would stai a good temp . i think for me becaus for dark grai the aug . temp . is 48 deg . it all depend on how hot your dog like to be how warm the usual ar what time of year aug tamp . at the locat for the doghous . how often will the dog be in the doghous . what time of dai will the dog be in the doghous and what the aug . temp natur for the doghous locat .
28563	10	white it will make the doghous cooler in the summer . the darker the color the more the doghous will absorb heat therefor white would beth best color .
28564	10	light grai light grai would affect the insid of the doghous by not allow it to get to hot for the dog and it offer a nice place for the dog to cool down if it is hot outsid . black and dark grai would be to hot i think and white would be to cold for comfort .
28565	10	white might keep it cooler
28566	10	light grai it will affect the doghous by when it is hot out it will stai cooler than a black doghous becaus it attract less heat energi but if it is colder it will help attract enough heat to be warmer than a white doghous like in the experi compar to a high temperatur of 54 deg calcium from black light grei wa a 46 deg high . so would be much cooler in hot weather .
28567	10	black if thei paint it black then the doghous would becom warmer insid becaus darker color attract sunlight .
28568	10	white so the insid stai cool sinc white it absorb less energi .
28569	10	black black is the best color for the doghous becaus it absorb more energi from the light . the averag temperatur insid a black doghous would be 53 degre calcium so the dog would be warm outdoor .
28570	10	white it would keep the insid of the doghous colder than the darker color on .
28571	10	black black paint would make the temperatur insid the doghous warmer . in the experi the black lid trial averag temperatur wa 53 deg c the highest of all the other averag temperatur . compar to the other lid the black paint produc 5 deg c 8 deg c and 11 deg c more . thu the insid of the doghous would be warmest if paint black .
28572	10	light grai i chose the light grei color becaus it wont be to hot or to cold insid the doghous .
28573	10	dark grai if it to hot outsid it cool insid the doghous . if it cold outsid it not so cold insid .
28574	10	white the doghous would be cooler insid so the dog will want togo in it on a hot dai
28575	10	light grai i would choos the light grai becaus in brandi and jerri s experi thei figur out that darker lid do absorb more heat than lighter lid . so i would not want to have the doghous to be to hot black lid or to cold white lid . so i just thought that the good amount of hot and cold wa light grai .
28576	10	black i think that thei should us black becaus if it get dirti then you wont beagl to tell .
28577	10	light grai i like footbal . i like poni . i like chocol . i like race car . i dont like your stupid test
28578	10	white the white pant reflex the light not ex sob it like black . the white pant will keep the dog cool in the doghous when it is warm outsid . but the onli problem is it would get cold dure the winter when there is littl sun .
28579	10	white a white doghous will make the doghous not as worm as black . our high data wa 53 deg chin the lid color wa black our low data wa 42 deg c white the lid color wa white the differ wa 11 deg c .
28580	10	white if there is white paint on the doghous then it wont get as hot as if thei paint it black . the lighter the paint then the cooler insid it will be for the dog .
28581	10	dark grai dark grai can keep the doghous warm in the winter and cool dure the summer .
28582	10	dark grai thi color dark grai might affect the dog hous by make it warmer for the anim insid . i chose dark grai instead of white or black becaus if the doghous wa white or light grai the insid temperatur would be colder than if it wa black . at the same time howev the insid temperatur might becom too hot for the anim insid caus it to becom uncomfort . as the data from the experi show the averag for the black color lid wa 53 deg c while thea averag temperatur for the white color lid wa 42 deg c . thi show that darker color heat up more quickli when expos to light energi than lighter color . i chose the color dark grai becaus that wai when the temperatur outsid is colder the doghous will obtain more heat from the sunlight that it expos to . in turn the doghous might act as an insul . in the summer howev it will not becom as hot insid the doghous as it would if it wa black . thi wai by choos a color that is neither extrem dark or extrem light thi doghous will have a reason for each season .
28583	10	white becaus the differ color lid did chang the temp of the insid of the contain i would put a white roof on the doghous
28584	10	light grai i think the color light grai would be good to paint the doghous . i think thi becaus i know that dog need a cooler temperatur to be comfort and it cant be too hot insid . it cannot be too cold either though . from the experi the black lid wa clearli the on that made the jar hottest and white made it less hot . you want someth in between so i chose light grai to be on the safe side .
28585	10	white white is the lightest color becaus it is light the temperatur in the doghous will decreas but if you choos ad parker color like black . the color will absorb the heat and increas the temperatur .
28586	10	black if the doghous wa black it would absorb more heat in the winter and keep the heat lock in .
28587	10	white white would work for insid becaus you can c control textur in insid the doghous
28588	10	white if you want to keep the doghous cool you would want the roof to be white becaus white is the color that doesnt t hold in heat compar to black . the black insid the glass wa about 53 deg c . the dark grai wa about 48 deg c . the light grai wa still 45 deg c but the white wa much cooler with about 42 deg c . the best choic would beth coolest temperatur which would be white .
28589	10	light grai the temperatur insid the hous wouldnt be so hot becaus the color would be light grai which ha the second lowest temperatur averag out of the four . it went up 20 22 deg c from it start temperatur while dark grai and black had higher temperatur increas . white had the lowest which would be too cold . the dog ha fur so it should be abl to be warm enough but also cant get too hot so light grai would beth best .
28590	10	white it ll keep the doghous warm but the temperatur wont be so hot that it ll be uncomfort for the dog .
28591	10	light grai thi will make it so the dog will not get so warm insid the doghous .
28592	10	white white becaus it will keep the doghous an averag of 42 deg c .
28593	10	white it would affect it becaus the lighter the color the less heat it absorb so the cooler the dog will be . i know thi becaus in the experi the color white had the least at 42 deg c
28594	10	white if thei paint the doghous white it will be cooler in the summer becaus light color attract less heat .
28595	10	dark grai dark grai is the best answer becaus a dog doesn t want to be to hot or to cold and 48 degre is a good temper for a doghous .
28596	10	dark grai dark grai becaus the dog ha fur and the fur keep the dog warm and the dark grai color is a littl cold and a littl warm . if the doghous wa black then the dog would get too hot . if the doghous wa white the dog would get too cold . dark grai is an averag temperatur .
28597	10	white white will affect the hous becaus it will keep the doghous cooler becaus lighter color dont absorb much heat . if the color wa black the doghous would be hotter becaus darker color absorb most heat .
28598	10	dark grai it kinda a dark color so the temperatur in the doghous can increas to 45 deg c .
28599	10	light grai why i pick light grai is becaus when the light shine on the doghous it will have some sunlight in the doghous but it will also have a littl shade . anoth reason is when it dark out you will actual be abl to seeth doghous unlik when it black you cant seeth doghous at all .
28600	10	white white becaus it would be much cooler in the doghous becaus black attract more heat energi from the air
28601	10	white white is the best choic becaus in the lid vs air temperatur we found that when we had a white lid on the jar the jar air wa the coolest out of the three other choic thi can help b case when it sunni outsid then the doghous will be cooler flow the dog to be in ana comfort inform
28602	10	dark grai in the summer dark grei wouldnt be as cool as white paint but cooler then black . in the winter it would be a lot warmer than white though not as warm as black . in the experi dark grei averag air temperatur 48 deg c wa the averag between white averag air temperatur 42 deg c and black air temperatur 53 deg c . also dark grei result were consist throughout the trial stai at 48 deg c . therefor the doghous temperatur would probabl be more consist year round with dark grei paint than with white black or light grei paint which were less constant .
28603	10	light grai the light grai color will keep the doghous at a manag temp . it wont be to hot or to cold . the lighter the color the cooler it will be . the darker the color the hotter it will be . light grai would beth perfect color .
28604	10	black black becaus black attract sunlight
28605	10	light grai i think that the best color for the doghous is light grei becaus it wouldnt get too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter .
28606	10	white paint the doghous white would decreas the amount of heat absorb insid the doghous . thi is becaus light color reflect sunlight awai more than darker color like black and black absorb light more than lighter color . the experi prove that darker color absorb more heat and increas the insid temperatur of the object .
28607	10	white there ar mani breed of dog but some ar better in colder weather than warmer on . for these type of dog thei should have a white doghous to keep the dog cool in the hot summer . on averag the white color wa 11 degre cooler than black color .
28608	10	light grai thi will make the doghous cooler in the summer than dark grai paint and black paint and it will also keep it warmer in the winter than the white paint .
28609	10	white i would paint the doghous white . the reason i would do thi is becaus it will keep the doghous cool insid becaus it doesnt absorb much energi . if you look at the data tabl it show that the lighter the color the cooler it is insid . it also show that white absorb less energi than the other color .
28610	10	light grai a darker color absorb more heat then alight er color . which is why light grai would be a good choic . in the winter it could absorb a good amount of heat to keep the dog warm . and in the summer keep him cool .
28611	10	white the white doghous would keep the doghous colder then the other doghous . the data tabl show that anyth black also robe more light becaus the temperatur averag is 53 deg c and the temperatur averag for white is 42 deg c . also dog have fur so thei dont need to be warm in the winter .
28612	10	white it wont get too hot insid . accord to the data tabl the white lid temperatur wa the least compar to all of the other color .
28613	10	white it would give the insid of the doghous al lighter effect .
28614	10	dark grai so that the hous count be that hot nor cold in the center or too hot in the summer .
28615	10	light grai i think high grai would be a good choic becaus if it wa hot out te dog wouldnt get to hot and if it wa cold out it wouldnt be to cold .
28616	10	dark grai thi color will absorb some heat but not a lot so it will be good in winter and summer
28617	10	white if you were to paint a doghous i would paint it white becaus the data show that white had the lowest temperatur out of all of the color of the jar . so the dog doesnt get too hot if it were paint black .
28618	10	black black color would be good becaus it absorb all the light and keep the doghous warm
28619	10	light grai the color will make it so the dog doesnt have to much heat but a littl bit of heat so that the dog doesnt get cold dure the winter if he is outsid
28620	10	black black had the highest averag temperatur ensur that the dog would stai nice and warm . the averag black temperatur wa 53 deg wherea the averag white temperatur wa onli 42 deg leav an 11 deg differ .
28621	10	dark grai i chose dark grai becaus it would keep the dog hous reason warm without get to warm . i also think it would be warmer in colder climat and not as hot as black in warmer climat .
28622	10	light grai becaus it is not a dark color so it wouldnt be too hot in the doghous plu it is not complet light so it wouldnt get too cold .
28623	10	white in the summer the dog will not be as hot becaus the white point will reflect the sun .
28624	10	light grai i would paint the doghous alight grai becaus it a color that wont attract to much sun so that in the summer the dog ha a place togo where he can be cool and feel refresh .
28625	10	black it wont be abl to see it en the night
28626	10	light grai if i were to build a doghous with the paint color accord to brandi and jerri s experi i would chose the color light grai to us for mani reason . first becaus it reflect the sun enough to stai cool but it still ha the pigment to absorb the color .
28627	10	light grai i chose light grei becaus it wouldnt get to cold or to hot for the dog .
28628	10	white thi will keep the doghous cooler insid to keep the dog from overh in the summer .
28629	10	light grai code 98745 16956 666577810 123456789 10 code
28630	10	white the color white will keep the doghous cooler then ani other darker color .
28631	10	white white might affect the temperatur in the doghous becaus in the result it show the color white ha the least amount of heat so if you want to keep your dog more cool brandi and jerri should us the color white .
28632	10	light grai the best paint color would be light grai becaus accord to brandi and jerri s experi the air insid the jar would measur to 45 deg c after ten minut . although the start temperatur mai vari the averag of 45 deg c is reason warm fora dog as to keep it comfort .
28633	10	light grai alight grai color would be perfect fora doghous becaus the averag temperatur of air insid the jar wa 45 deg c . thi temperatur is in the middl of too hot 53 deg c or too cold 42 deg c . the dog would not get too hot or too cold in the doghous . 45 deg c is a temperatur that dog would love . therefor the light grai color would beth best choic to paint the doghous .
28634	10	light grai light grai might have a affect on th doghous becaus in the summer it wont attract the sun and it wont heat up as much as a dark doghous .
28635	10	white thei should paint the doghous white becaus if it is white it is more like to stai at a cooler temperatur . if the doghous wa paint black it would have the highest temperatur of 54 deg c while if you paint the doghous white it would have a low temperatur of 41 deg c . that is why thei should paint the doghous white .
28636	10	white thi color will affect the insid of the doghous becaus if it is a black lid or doghous it is go to be realli hot insid of the doghous becaus black attract the sun but if you were to have it be white it would be a littl cooler becaus the sun isnt as attract to white as black . like thei did in the experi with the black lid on the jar and the temperatur wa rise faster than it would with the whit lid .
28637	10	white white might affect the insid of the doghous becaus when it hot out and the sun it the doghous it will be cooler in there the nit will be outsid . darker color absorb more heat energi then lighter color .
28638	10	black black is the best color to us to paint the doghous becaus it will keep the insid of the doghous warmer than the other color . in the glass jar experi the jar with the black lid wa warmest at 53 deg c compar to 48 deg c 45 deg c and 42 deg c .
28639	10	white white will effect the insid of the doghous by make it cooler . in the experi the with color had the lowest temperatur 42 compar to the other color .
28640	10	black the color black can absorb all the color and make it hot in their for the dog .
28641	10	white so there would be lest heat energi in the doghous
28642	10	dark grai the dog will want to surviv the winter but not be burn up in summer so dark grai can do both of these thing
28643	10	black if thei paint the doghous black it will be warmer insid becaus it show in the experi that the darker the color lid the higher the temperatur insid the jar wa . in the data the averag for black wa 53 deg c and the averag for white a lighter color wa 42 deg c . thi show that if thei paint the doghous black the dog insid would be warmer .
28644	10	white us white as the color of the outsid oft he doghous will keep the doghous cooler than if the color wa black . accord to the data chart the glass jar with a white color lid on stai cooler than when the glass jar had a black colour lid .
28645	10	white if the doghous is a differ color then it might be hotter or colder . like if the dig hous wa black then it would hot like in the experi black averag wa 53 degre calcium . white wa an averag of 42 degre cell . darker color attract more light .
28646	10	light grai i chose light grai becaus on a warm dai it will deflect some of the heat and on cold dai when the sun is up it will keep it a littl bit warm .
28647	10	dark grai becaus it a dark color but not to dark for summer so it not too hot .
28648	10	white white would make the doghous warm but not too warm so that the dog overh and not too cold that it would freez . if you us black within 10 minut on a hot summer dai the doghous would reach 54 deg c in which the dog would probabl get wai too hot . white would be better for the dog sinc it had the lowest end temperatur . if you us white it would onli get to about 42 deg c which is a reason temperatur fora dog .
28649	10	white color of white will help the dog stai cool on a hot sunni dai
28650	10	dark grai it would not realli affect the color right awai it would take awhil for it to chang .
28651	10	black if you paint the doghous black the doghous will be warmer becaus black attract heat . the data prove that with temperatur at 54 52 54 and 53 . all the other color ar in the 40 s . so choos black will help the dog stai warm .
28652	10	white white will absorb the least amount of heat into the doghous .
28653	10	black
28654	10	white it would not absorb as much energi if it wa white so it would be cooler insid a white doghous rather than a black doghous . for exampl the averag temperatur insid the black doghous wa 53 deg c which is realli hot while the averag temperatur insid the white doghous wa onli 42 deg c which would be better fora dog .
28655	10	light grai alight grai color is good becaus by look at the trial that color wa in the middl so not to hot not to cold . the dog is not go to be hot on a sunni dai it will be just right .
28656	10	dark grai the dark grai color could affect the doghous by keep the temperatur insid of the doghous the same throughout it us . in the experi the dark grai lid kept the temperatur the same throughout each of the trial .
28657	10	white it would effect the doghous by make it cooler than the other color would becaus in the experi the jar with a white lid lighter color had an averag of 42 deg c while the darkest color lid black had an averag of 53 deg c .
28658	10	light grai i chose light grei becaus the color doesnt get as hot yet not to cold .
28659	10	dark grai the dark grai roof will keep the doghous the same temperatur . for when brandi and jerri us a dark grai lid the high data for it wa 48 deg c and the low wa 48 deg c .
28660	10	white by paint the doghous white the doghous air temperatur will be lower . the jar with a white lid temperatur wa 42 deg c and the jar with a black lid wa 53 deg c . the white jar air temperatur wa 11 deg c cooler than the black jar .
28661	10	white it will make it cooler in the summer .
28662	10	dark grai i chose dark grai becaus that wai it will keep the dog warm in the winter but not too hot in the summer it had an averag temperatur of 48 deg c the darker the color the more energi taken in
28663	10	light grai i choos thi color becaus if the doghous wa a dark color it would absorb more heat and if the doghous wa to light it would be to cold so if you do a medium color it wouldnt be to hot or to cold it would be just right
28664	10	white white becaus white can defens from the sun
28665	10	light grai if u us black then it will get real hot in the sun so your better off us light grai
28666	10	black black would affect the doghous by be veri hot insid all the time and the dog might not like that .
28667	10	black if the doghous is paint black i think that the doghous will get the more heat deg c becaus the averag of the c color black for min ina glass jar wa 53 deg c .
28668	10	light grai light grai might effect the doghous becaus in the spring and summer it wont get to hot and in the winter it wont get to cold .
28669	10	black i would us the color black for the paint color for the doghous becaus it will keep the dog warmer . the averag temperatur wa 53 deg in the jar that 5 more degre than dark grai 8 more degre than light grai and 11 more degre than the paint color white .
28670	10	black thi might affect the doghous becaus it will keep the doghous warm and the dog will be warm . becaus the temper re for the black wa 53 deg f .
28671	10	light grai i chose light grai becaus you dont want your dog to be to hot or to cold
28672	10	white the white wont absorb as much light as the black keep it cooler for the dog .
28673	10	white the color white will make cooler insid of the doghous becaus white had the lowest temperatur such as 42 deg c and 41 deg c . when the color black had temperatur of 54 deg c and 52 deg c
28674	10	white the reason i pick thi color is it doe not prove as much heat . and the dog is alli in their to keep awai from the hot sun or the to got bed but with the color white it can do both of these thing and still stai col
28675	10	black i think the color black would make the dog hous hotter becaus black attract more heat to anyth that it on and that why i think black would be a horribl choic fora color . also in the tabl that brandi and jerri produc the color black ha the the highest g percentag of of heat and the averag heat of black wa 53 . 25 deg .
28676	10	dark grai so i said dark grai becaus black will be too hot in the summertim becaus darker color absorb more heat . the dark grai seem like a good choic becaus thi color will not be too hot on a hot dai .
28677	10	dark grai the darker the lid color the greater the increas in air temperatur in the glass jar so i chose the color dark grai . thi color might affect the insid of the doghous by increas the air temperatur into a cooler hotter area for the dog to stai in but the temperatur would be about 48 deg c which is a good air temperatur of a doghous and it rang in the middl of 45 deg to 53 deg becaus black with the averag of 53 deg c would be too cold for the dog to stai in .
28678	10	white i would sai white paint would be best for the doghous becaus it the color that least absorb energi . if you want to save monei i would suggest white becaus it save your monei and energi . thei mention that darker the color the more energi absorb . the doghous would be not that warm if it wa white . there would be more light if it wa black but less light if it wa white .
28679	10	black black will chang the color becaus if it sunni outsid it would be barker and hotter caus the sun attract more then the other color . as seen on the result . the averag wa about 53 deg .
28680	10	black it will absorb the heat for your dog
28681	10	white the white color will caus the insid of the doghous to be cooler than the other color . as seen in the experi it would be on averag 3 deg cooler than alight grai on 6 deg cooler than a dark grai on and 11 deg cooler than a black on . white would caus the least heat insid the doghous out of all the avail color .
28682	10	white if you pick a dark color it will absorb more light and white reflect the light .
